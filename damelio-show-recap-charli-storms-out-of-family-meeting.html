She’s a monster,” Dixie told her parents. Charli chimed in, saying, “I think there needs to be a talk about where food can be left in the house for her to not get it.”</p><p>Dixie explained that she had stored a box of cupcakes — nine of which were chocolate — high off the ground, but Rebel still got to them.</p><p>“I am very worried about her because she’s bigger than she’s ever been,” Heidi told her daughters. “We have to really talk about this and come up with a plan because she’s gonna die.”</p><p>Dixie whispered, “Execute her?” with a subtle laugh.</p><p>“What the f—k is wrong with you? That’s so mean,” Charli hit back. “You can’t put that out into the world.”</p><p>Heidi can be heard off camera saying, “Yeah, scratch that.”</p><p>“[The idea] of me killing her? OK. Yes, because <a href=#>I’m going to kill your dog</a>,” Dixie told her sister sarcastically. “That’s what I was being serious about.”</p><p>Charli stormed out of the meeting while Dixie rolled her eyes and told Marc: “Charli’s a bitch.” Not wanting to get in the middle of his daughters, Marc wanted to diffuse the situation, revealing in his confessional that the family “can’t afford them not to be speaking.”</p><p>However, in her confessional, Dixie explained that the fight between the family was “not about Rebel at all.” But she was hesitant to reveal the real issues on the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Charli-D-Amelio-Storms-Out-of-Family-Meeting-After-Sister-Dixie-s-Joke-About-Dog-Rebel-Execute-Her-456.jpg><p>In the previous D’Amelio Show episode — season 3, episode 3 — which was also released on Wednesday, Dixie made <a href=#>reference to “the whole parents situation”</a> that “got dropped in my lap.” It’s unclear what went down between Marc and Heidi, but Dixie made it clear that it’s something she’s “not ready to talk about.”</p><p>Dixie made a second reference to something that went down between her parents during episode 4 as well.</p><p>“In the back of the car on the way to the <a href=#>Kids’ Choice Awards</a>, seeing my parents happy pissed me off so much,” she said. “I had to deal with all of their issues and now they’re just fine.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During Charli’s confessional, one of The D’Amelio Show producers alluded to a situation that occurred during “that three months of Dancing With the Stars.” Seemingly holding back tears, Charli said she “didn’t know where to begin,” before the episode came to an end.</p><p>New episodes of The D’Amelio Show release via Hulu on Wednesdays.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuapZWhtrB50qGmsGWimrCivIycn5qqnJ56tMDOq6SsZZ%2BqwW67xWadmqWZocZuucSeq6Kml2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

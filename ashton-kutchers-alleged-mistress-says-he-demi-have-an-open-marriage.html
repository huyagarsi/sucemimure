At least, according to Ashton’s maybe-probably mistress, Brittney Jones, who continues to give interviews to Star Magazine and Radar like she thinks she was riding Tiger Woods for a year. By Brittney’s own account, she and Ashton only had sex (allegedly) a few times, and there was some texting, but it all seemed very easy-breezy hookup style. While I believed Brittney about the sex, I’m not believing all of the extra crap she’s shoveling about Demi and Ashton’s marriage.</p><p>Still, people are interested in the theories about how Demi and Ashton make it work. And the answer is not “denial”. Brittney’s theory (which she told to Star Magazine, which Hollywood Life has excerpts from) is Demi lets Ashton bone whoever he wants, and sometimes Demi joins in:</p><p>After fighting off rumors of infidelity and an impending divorce, Ashton Kutcher’s alleged mistress, Brittney Jones claims that his marriage to Demi Moore isn’t as exclusive as the couple makes it out to be.</p><p>Poor Ashton Kutcher, he chose the wrong girl with whom to allegedly fool around . The 21-year-old aspiring chef, Brittney Jones, is at it again, going on record with Star magazine — and this time pointing the finger at Ashton and Demi Moore, claiming that her tryst with Ashton was just his taking advantage of the couple’s open marriage policy.</p><p>“Ashton said he and Demi have an open relationship and have threesomes often,” she said. “I didn’t feel at all like he had just cheated on his wife. It felt normal and OK.”</p><p>When news about Ashton’s cheating scandal broke , everyone assumed Demi, 47, would be devastated that Ashton, 32, had allegedly broken his marriage vows and that the couple’s 5- year union might be over, but according to Brittney, Demi is actually upset over her own lack of involvement.</p><p>“He said they share women, but he isn’t supposed to go off and sleep with women on his own,” she told Star. “He said Demi had to be there and that Demi likes to pick the girls out.”</p><p>While Brittney thought she could be Ashton’s girlfriend on the side, he quickly squashed that possibility. “He explained that he and Demi had a deal where they had to share lovers. He felt bad that he had been with me and didn’t share,” she claimed.</p><p>Ashton and Demi have vehemently denied Brittney’s cheating allegations which she’s continued to make for several weeks in a row.</p><p>[From <a href=#>Hollywood Life</a>]</p><p>Did anyone notice the contradiction? “Ashton said he and Demi have an open relationship” and then “He said they share women, but he isn’t supposed to go off and sleep with women on his own. He said Demi had to be there and that Demi likes to pick the girls out.” Which is it? Ashton can bone any girl (“open”) or he can only bone the uggos that Demi approves of (not “open,” just weird)?</p><p>So, basically, I want Brittney to shut up now. She’s messing with the original tabloid story that I believed – that Ashton is a lousy cheater and the Demi is in severe denial.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/wenn3018881.jpg alt=wenn3018881 title=wenn3018881 width=580 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/wenn3018446.jpg alt=wenn3018446 title=wenn3018446 width=580 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmampgaX16e8Csn62nnpS4tsDCoZyrq4%2BWua2xxp6bmKWZqMGzsdKslqyZqaisqbG%2BnZymoY%2BdrrexvpqlmKegmrugucCrqaKZl5p8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

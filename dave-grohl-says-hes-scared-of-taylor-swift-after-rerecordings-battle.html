The "Shake It Off" songstress announced her intention to re-record her old material when the masters of the six studio albums she released under the Big Machine label were sold to the Hollywood mogul Scooter Braun, with whom Swift has a <a href=#>complicated history</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star has already started the roll-out process for her re-recordings, with Fearless (Taylor's Version) coming out in April of this year, and Red (Taylor's Version) set for a November debut on streaming services.</p><p>So far, Swift's decision has hugely paid off, with Fearless (Taylor's Version) being critically well-received, and becoming the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest first-week debut</a> for a country album in six years. It has also gained her the respect of some industry greats â€” including, but not limited to <a href=#>Sir Paul McCartney</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Times Taylor Swift Was Featured On Songs By Other Artists</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And the latest prominent figure in music to praise Swift's handling of her masters being sold is Dave Grohl of The Foo Fighters. Appearing on the October cover of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, Grohl complimented Swift on her strength for standing up for herself in the industry and appeared to recognize the appeal of revisiting your old material as an artist. He said, "F*** yeah, girl. Hell hath no fury. Now I'm scared of her! I would be so nerdy and into it. I think it's so much fun."</p><p>When Swift released Fearless (Taylor's Version), she reflected on the personal effect of re-recording her old tracks. The "cardigan" songwriter penned <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a note</a> on Instagram, saying, "this process has been more fulfilling and emotional than i could've imagined and has made me even more determined to re-record all of my music."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Rock Legend Dave Grohl Amassed His $320 Million Fortune</a></span></p><p>It's not the first time Grohl and Swift have been associated. The former Nirvana drummer previously appeared on The Late Late Show with James Corden to talk about the time he sung with Swift, and the songstress helped him to not appear stoned, at a party thrown by Paul McCartney. And <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even further back</a>, Grohl congratulated the star on her first-ever Grammy nomination in 2007.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans are loving the somewhat unexpected friendship between the two, with one Swiftie writing, "I love Dave so much he is talented and a kind soul", and another tweeting, "Dave probably has a Taylor Swift Stan account. Jk. He's the coolest". While a third was hopeful that Grohl's praise of Swift might mean that The Foo Fighters nab a feature on one of her upcoming re-releases.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Twitter Reacts To Taylor Swift Teasing Collab With Phoebe Bridgers On 'Red'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6VYrSzu8elZKyZqah6qbHSZqqcmaKasW67xWarmrGcpL9uv9aina1lkZvBpr6Mq5yrnZOkv6W1zaCqZpqRqcGtsY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

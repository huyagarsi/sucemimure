One week after mommy bloggers who follow the Melissa & Joey star’s Instagram account lashed out at a photo of her 2-year-old with a pacifier, the actress isn’t mincing words in response.</p><p>“I’ve learned that I just have to be me. It’s my page — if you don’t like it, go away!” Hart, 38, told <a href=#><strong>HuffPost Live</strong></a> in an interview March 17. <strong>“</strong>Make your comments if you want, but I’m not going to look at them, or care.” Mom of three Hart — on HuffPost Live to promote the 100th episode of ABC Family’s Melissa & Joey — reasoned that many are quick to judge (or try to parent) from behind computer screens, but never in real time. “Everybody thinks they can tell you what to do. If they have the guts to say it to my face, I think I have the guts to punch ’em.”</p><p>Though she contends with “high school stuff” on social media, Hart says she’ll continue to keep her kids (Mason, 9, Braydon, 7, and Tucker, 2, with husband <strong>Mark Wilkerson</strong>) in the public eye when the time is right.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The TV veteran likes to expose her boys to the perks of fame — like being mom’s dates to the Frozen premiere — but all in all, they aren’t too interested in showbiz. Or, at least aren’t too interested in Hart’s industry credits.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I tried to show them Clarissa [Explains It All] once, and they repeated some of the Sabrina [the Teenage Witch] lines to me. Their friends are watching it, but [my boys] are on iMovie making their own trailers, taking their own videos – being TV to them is not special,” Hart told HuffPost Live.</p><p>Hart’s latest series, Melissa & Joey, reaches a major milestone March 18 with its 100th episode, and the actress and her longtime costar, <strong>Joey Lawrence</strong>, will leave the series behind when it wraps for good in August. “I’s bittersweet, because now I get to move on with my life,” says the Clarissa Explains It All and Sabrina, the Teenage Witch alum, who tells HuffPost she is putting all her energy into her and her husband’s kids’ clothing line, King of Harts, since her show was cancelled. “It’s like my fourth baby — it’s my passion project.”</p><p><strong>Have a question you’d like to ask a celebrity?

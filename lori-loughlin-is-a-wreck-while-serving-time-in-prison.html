Her mind keeps telling her that something will go horribly wrong in prison or that her stay could be prolonged.”</p><p>The actress <a href=#>reported to Dublin</a> on Friday, October 30, after initially requesting to serve her time at the federal correctional institution in Victorville, California. An insider told Us at the time that Dublin, the same facility where <a href=#><strong>Felicity Huffman</strong></a> served 11 days of her sentence, had “lower COVID-19 numbers.” A second insider told Us last month that Loughlin <a href=#>is hoping to be released by Christmas.</a></p><p>Loughlin and husband <a href=#><strong>Mossimo Giannulli</strong> </a>were arrested as part of the <a href=#>nationwide college admissions</a> scandal in March 2019. The duo, who originally pleaded not guilty, were accused of paying $500,000 in bribes to facilitate their daughters, <a href=#><strong>Bella Giannulli </strong></a>and<a href=#><strong> Olivia Jade Giannulli’s</strong></a> acceptances into the University of Southern California. In May, the former Fuller House star and the 57-year-old fashion <a href=#>designer agreed to change their pleas to guilty as part of a plea deal.</a></p><p>Three months later, the former Hallmark Channel star was <a href=#>sentenced to two months behind bars</a>, a $150,000 fine, two years of supervised release and 100 hours of community service. Mossimo, for his part, was ordered to five months in prison, a $250,000 fine and two years of supervised release with 250 hours of community service. He has until November 19 to surrender and is expected to serve his time at The Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc.</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p>Loughlin broke <a href=#>down in tears while addressing the judge at her virtual </a>hearing on August 21.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I went along will the plan to give my daughters an unfair advantage in the college admissions process,” she told the judge. “In doing so, ignored my intuition and allowed myself to be swayed from my moral compass. I thought I was acting out of love for my children, but in reality, I had only undermined and diminished my daughters’ abilities and accomplishments.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lori-Loughlin-Is-Expecting-to-Be-Released-from-Prison-Before-2021.jpg><p>Loughlin concluded, “While I wish I could go back and do things differently, I can only take responsibility and move forward. I have great faith in God and I believe in redemption and I will do everything in my power to redeem myself and use this experience as a catalyst to do good and give back for the rest of my life.”</p><p>For more, watch the video above and pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalp6Keeq271KCfpaGeYra0ecBmrqudk6B6uLTIpZxmq5Wnw6q6xmaroqWVYravec%2BroKynnmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

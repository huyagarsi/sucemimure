A five-foot statue of a seated female angel was placed near Moore’s tomb, and her family reportedly purchased up to 12 additional gravesites to ensure privacy. One floral arrangement near Moore’s grave was in the shape of the letter <i>M,</i> a nod to the famous wall decoration in the star’s character’s apartment on <i>The Mary Tyler Moore Show.</i></p><p>Before the iconic Hollywood star was buried, her family and friends attended a brief service at a small white chapel. “It was very quiet, a small group,” Fairfield Police Lieutenant James Perez told the <i>Connecticut Post</i>. “There was a brief service. It’s a beautiful site that she’s at. It’s nice what the family did. It was a nice little send-off for her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/mary-tyler-moore-gravesite-8bbd3b06-87fc-4e31-b86a-85682ce8e01d.jpg><p>Perez told the newspaper the only celebrity he recognized at the ceremony was <b>Bernadette Peters</b>, who starred alongside Moore in the 1990 TV movie <i>The Last Best Year.</i></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>Moore’s longtime rep confirmed her death in a statement to <i>Us Weekly</i> on Wednesday, saying, “Today, beloved icon Mary Tyler Moore passed away at the age of 80 in the company of friends and her loving husband of over 33 years, Dr. S.

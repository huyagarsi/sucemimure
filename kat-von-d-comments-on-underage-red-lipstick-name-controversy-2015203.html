The controversy surrounding the name of her matte red lipstick began earlier this week after customers accused her of promoting sexual misconduct and promiscuity to her teenage fanbase.&nbsp;</p><p>“Underage Red. I have never expected everyone to understand or see things the way that I do,” her lengthy note began. “With that being said, I can understand why some have found reason to be offended in regards to my choice in naming a lipstick ‘Underage Red’ – but I feel the need to correct those of you who have clearly misinterpreted the name itself, and the inspiration behind it.”&nbsp;</p><p>The world-renowned tattoo artist behind her popular eponymous brand, 33, went on to detail how she first fell in love with bold red lipstick at the age of 16, even though her parents felt it was inappropriate to wear it at that time.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“It has NEVER been a goal of mine to inspire sexualization of any sort, let alone a destructive lifestyle,” Von D explained. “Anyone who knows or follows me, is very aware of my personal lifestyle choices which include celibacy, sobriety, conscious living and [above feminism], human rights. Although, I would never force my views and opinions onto others, I most definitely find it offensive being accused of the opposite.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Von D said she felt the comments online, which implied that she was promoting “the degradation of women, statutory rape, sexual behavior, human trafficking, underage drinking, or even idealization of fleeting youth,” go against everything she stands for.&nbsp;</p><p>“So, No. I refuse to sacrifice my integrity and creative freedom. No,” she wrote. “I will not be pulling ‘Underage Red’ from my collection. And No. This is not an apology.”&nbsp;</p><p>Do you feel Kat Von D’s “Underage Red” lipstick title is offensive?

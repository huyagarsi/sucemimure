She said, “I battled to remain in it, and they kept me in it.”</p><p>In the courtroom, she added:</p><p>“I’m not sure whether I’ll make the final cut or how much I’ll be paid. It was tough to keep focused on the film.”</p><p>According to the Texas native, her last parts in the film were a “very pared-down version of that character.” The actress co-stars with Jason Momoa in the role of Princess Mera. She continued, saying:</p><p>“I was given a screenplay and then given updated versions of the script that removed action parts.” That showed my character and another character—two people battling with one another, without giving any secrets away. They effectively took a lot of my responsibilities away from me. They just deleted a large number.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Amber-Heard-3-1.jpg alt="Amber Heard" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Never Back Down actress also claimed that her screentime in the sequel, which will be published in March 2023, was reduced to 10 minutes.&nbsp;As “fan pressure” to remove Heard from the sequel grew, one of the film’s producers, Peter Safran, talked to Deadline in July 2021 about the problem. He stated:</p><p>“I don’t believe we’ll ever respond to sheer fan pressure, to be honest…&nbsp;Because, you know, you have to do what you think is best for the film. If it’s James Wan and Jason Momoa, we thought it should be Amber Heard. That’s exactly what it was.”</p><p>It seems that movie producers and diehard fans of the series have achieved a compromise in which Heard’s screentime has been severely reduced but she has not been completely cut from the film.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Let’s get a few things straight about <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#Aquaman</a>:</p><p>1.

Warner Bros. said the 36-year-“lack old’s of chemistry” with Jason Momoa almost got her fired from her part.&nbsp;In her pre-recorded deposition, the agent addressed “online claims” that Aquaman executives wanted her out of the picture owing to the negative exposure the actress had received throughout the current legal dispute.</p><p>According to Jessica Kovacevic, the studio did not “want to recruit someone who gets poor publicity.” She continued, saying:</p><p>“No one wants to be associated with it.”</p><p>Heard’s career before and after her relationship with Pirates of the Caribbean actor Johnny Depp was also mentioned by the talent agency. Kovacevic argued that Heard should have been a well-known celebrity following the success of Aquaman, which was released in 2018 and grossed over a billion dollars.</p><p></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYppqVp3qpscCrm2aqlauyoriMrZ%2BarF2dsrN50pypnp2eYsGqucRmoKdlkabCornAp2RrZZiWwG6uxJ6lZqqVmcKkscNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

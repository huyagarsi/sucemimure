Yes, Derek — her husband, Derek “McDreamy” Shepherd, who died years ago. He yelled her name and she spun around and saw him before the <a href=#>episode came to an end</a>.</p><p>Following the shocking return, Pompeo, 51, and Dempsey, 54, revealed how the reunion came about, which began by her asking her former costar to go on a hike.</p><p>“I had known that Krista wanted to do a beach thing, and I was at the beach. Patrick and I weren’t hiking on the beach, but we were hiking in Malibu, which, you can see the beach. And the idea just struck me so I just said to him, would you ever consider coming and being a part of the storytelling this season?” she revealed in an interview with <a href=#>Deadline</a>. “I know that Patrick has his foundation in Maine where he helps cancer patients and cancer survivors, and that’s a huge effort of his, and I know that it’s important to him, also, to give people hope, and give people joy, and we wanted to bring something to this moment.”</p><p>Pompeo noted that she explained that <a href=#>having the reunion during</a> a <a href=#>time of “so much darkness” would provide</a> a “ray of light” for fans — and he loved the idea.</p><p>“We had a ball filming it,” she said. Dempsey echoed the sentiment, adding that they wanted to do something for the frontline workers and to <a href=#>make people feel better</a>.</p><p>“I think the whole atmosphere has changed, certainly working at the beach, and seeing everybody again was really a very healing process, and really rewarding, and a lot of fun,” the Bridget Jones’s Baby actor said. “And hopefully, that feeling translates, and the fans enjoy it. I know that they’ve been wanting us to get back together, and I think <a href=#>this will satisfy a lot of people</a>, and surprise a lot of people, hopefully.”</p><p>The Maine native also explained that it felt “very special” and “really comfortable” filming together again. Pompeo added that the spark came back immediately.</p><p>“It’s like riding a bike. We just have a chemistry and a dynamic that’s always served us well, and I think we have a genuine <a href=#>affection for each other</a>,” she said. “It was very healing to come back, and know that we’re doing something good, putting out a positive story, a healing story, going to make people smile.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Plus, fans can <a href=#>expect to see more of Derek</a>. “It’s more than the one scene,” showrunner Krista Vernoff said. “Patrick and Ellen and I were all there at the beginning of this; I wasn’t there for the pilot, but I was there for the first seven seasons, and that was 17 years ago. That was, like, a lifetime ago; my kids weren’t alive. It was so wild to walk out on that beach, and just be together again as these different people that we are now. But I can’t overstate how joyful and healing an experience this was.”</p><p>See photos of the reunion below.</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bcv6bF0maYp5mkpLq6ecSlo56mXaW8rrzEqGSopl2lrrW%2ByJyiZpyVor20sdisZKudpKq%2Fr3nArGSdnaKauHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

The 39-year-old multihyphenate is the first of six high-profile figures highlighted by the magazine <a href=#>for helping “shape” the last decade</a>.</p><p>“So I’d say 2010, 2011 was like, ‘I’ll do anything.’ Cupcakes, milkshakes,” she said of early days. “So I go to a milkshake place in Dubai, thinking, ‘Oh, it’s just, you know, some little milkshake store.’ Maybe, like, 250,000 people showed up to the Dubai mall. I had never seen anything like it before. We had to sneak out the back.”</p><p>The KKW Beauty mogul continued, “I mean, I took videos of the thousands, hundreds of thousands of people at the mall in Dubai. My mom [<a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>] and I looked at each other — because I made her come with me — and we were like, ‘Holy s–t. What is going on? A milkshake place?’”</p><p>According to Kardashian, there is “really nothing” the general public doesn’t already know about her. Beginning in October 2007, she let the world in on her behind-the-scenes life with her family’s E! reality series, <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>. The success of this long-running show <a href=#>has inspired several spinoffs</a>, including Kourtney & Khloé Take Miami, starring her sisters <a href=#><strong>Kourtney</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a>, and Life of Kylie, which featured the youngest KarJenner member, <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>.</p><p>Over a decade later, Keeping Up With the Kardashians is still going strong as it’s currently airing episodes from its 17th season. In regards to <a href=#>documenting her life on television</a>, Kim has no regrets.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’ve never regretted it. I’ve always felt, like, I’m so grateful to have all of those memories on-camera,” she explained. “I will look back and think, ‘Oh, my God, what was I wearing? Why is my makeup like that?’”</p><p>The Selfish author even admitted that she can “sit back and laugh” about how much she “cared” about making a name for herself early on, adding: “Oh my God, I was desperate!”</p><p>Scroll down to read more revelations from <a href=#>Kim’s The Cut interview</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKq5jKSYq5yRqLWqrc2sZKedp2LGsL7KZqSan5Gvtq%2BxjKKlrZ2iq7amw4xvZKudppq5osDIqKWsZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Is the fashion designer set to wed her boyfriend of two years, Louis Eisner?</p><p>US Weekly is reporting the 33-year-old was photographed with a noticeable piece of jewelry on her ring finger Monday night. Olsen and Eisner stepped out to take in a showing of the new Quentin Tarantino flick, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. They reportedly had a pre-movie dinner at a local Italian restaurant near Pacific Palisades theater they saw the film.</p><p>The Full House alum was dressed chic but casual in comfy baggy sweatpants, an oversized sweatshirt, and sunglasses. It was a departure from her usual jeans and blazer attire, but no one is talking about her outfit.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy birthday to Louis, Ashleyâ€™s boyfriend! Head to my story in instagram to learn more about him and see lots of photos of Ash and Lou. ðŸŽŠðŸŽŠðŸŽŠ <a href=# rel=nofollow>#ashleyolsen</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#louiseisner</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#happybirthday</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#couplegoals</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/Qo4XPrOueZ</a></p><p>â€” olsen oracle (@olsenoracle) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 31, 2019</a></p><p>Fans want to know what the deal is with the band on her left ring finger. Olsen is known for wearing rings and not caring what finger the ring is placed on. So, there is a chance she simply added the band to go with her baggy sweatpants outfit.</p><p>However, there is an equally good chance the Olsen twin is engaged to her artist man. She and Eisner have been dating for a while and appear to enjoy their time together. At least the handful of times they have been caught in public together. Maybe they are ready to take the next step.</p><p>Honestly, people wonâ€™t know one way or the other. Mary-Kate secretly wed husband Olivier Sarkozy and has never talked about it. Ashley is just like her twin sister, ultra-private about her personal life.</p><p>Since the twins lived life in the spotlight throughout their entire childhood, they have been extremely private in their adult lives. They rarely give interviews and work hard to keep the paparazzi at bay. The Olsen twins also declined to reprise their role as Michelle Tanner on Fuller House to keep their lives out of the Hollywood stoplight.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Are wedding bells ringing for Ashley Olsen? ðŸ‘° <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/g32SN6p3Wp</a><a href=# rel=nofollow>#AshleyOlsen</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#LouisEisner</a></p><p>â€” E! Online Asia (@eonlineasia) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 31, 2019</a></p><p>Ashely Olsen has been spotted wearing some new bling on her left ring finger. Rumors or speculation rather that she is engaged to boyfriend Louis Eisner have been heating up social media.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Unfortunately for inquiring minds, the only way to know if they are or are not engaged will be after they wed. A legal marriage license will be the only ways fans will get an answer.

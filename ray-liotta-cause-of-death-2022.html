The joke was told as a reaction to Liotta turning down the opportunity to play their late father in a miniseries that they were working on, only to have Liotta reprise the role in The Rat Pack, a television film that aired on HBO in 1998.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Randy Weaver Cause Of Death: American Survivalist Randy Weaver Dies At 74, Daughter Confirms</a></li><li><a href=#>Did Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson Break Up?

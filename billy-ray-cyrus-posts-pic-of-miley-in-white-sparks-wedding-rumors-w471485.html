Miley Cyrus’ manager confirms to <i>Us Weekly </i>that the singer and her fiancé, Liam Hemsworth, are not married. “[It was] just some great photos that happen to have been taken in a white dress,” her manager adds of the snap posted by Billy Ray Cyrus.</p><p><i>Original story below</i></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m so happy…you are happy <a href=#>@MileyCyrus</a>. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LcDV2UvMmV</a></p><p>— Billy Ray Cyrus (@billyraycyrus) <a href=#>March 10, 2017</a></p><p>Is she now Mrs. Hemsworth?! <b><a href=#>Billy Ray Cyrus</a></b> posted a photo of his daughter <b><a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a></b> in white, leading fans to speculate that she secretly married her fiancé, <b><a href=#>Liam Hemsworth</a></b>.&nbsp;</p><p>The <i>Still the King</i> actor, 55, shared a photo of the 24-year-old pop superstar beaming in an all-white outfit on Thursday, March 9. “I’m so happy…you are happy @mileycyrus,” he captioned the mysterious snap.</p><p>Billy Ray further fueled the rumors by retweeting several users who asked if the “Wrecking Ball” singer had tied the knot. “Did she get married….” one user asked, while another wrote, “I saw this and automatic thought wedding..” Another fan begged for clarity. “Did Miley get married?!

They got engaged in June 2012 but split a little over a year later in September 2013. They remained friends, though, and rekindled their romance in late 2015. After the reunion, Cyrus decided to start wearing her 3.5-carat Neil Lane engagement ring again, though a source told <i>Us Weekly</i> at the time that Hemsworth “never formally proposed again.”</p><p>The low-key couple have been more public with their romance in recent months. In October, they made their first red carpet appearance together in three years at Variety’s 2016 Power of Women luncheon in Beverly Hills. Cyrus also shared a pic of the duo kissing on New Year’s 2017 and wished her “best friend” Hemsworth a happy birthday on Instagram in January.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>The “We Can’t Stop” songstress and the<i> Independence Day: Resurgence</i> actor previously planned on exchanging vows in a small beachside ceremony in Australia last summer, but they ended up scrapping the idea. “Miley is pretty adamant about having a small, private ceremony,” a source previously told <i>Us.</i> “But Liam wants a really big wedding, so I’m sure they’ll have to compromise.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaboZyhxm6%2BwLJknLGiqsBuvM6sq6xloJ6wbrvFZqSipJWueqq6jLCfoqyVYsCxrdGkqmavlZmxqrrGZqmupZ%2BnwG7Dk3BobXBlZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

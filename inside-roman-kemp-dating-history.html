Whilst neither party has confirmed their alleged romance, the duo were snapped looking cosy at the Brit Awards afterparty in February. Despite their loved-up appearance, at the time, a spokesperson for Roman insisted that the stars "are friends."</p><h2>Jette Kerkoff</h2><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eaUAX-Omt0i data-wc=41>The former contestant has also been romantically linked to German model, Jette Kerkoff. The alleged couple reportedly grew close whilst soaking up the sun in Mykonos, and Roman has liked a string of her snaps over on Instagram.</p><h2>Codie Jones</h2><p id=eQK8ujRmjVC data-wc=31>Prior to this romance, Roman is thought to have dated Australian radio presenter, Codie Jones. The duo allegedly formed a strong bond following the heartbreaking death of their mutual friend Joe.</p><h2>Anne-Sophie Flury</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/06c2db7f617d-gettyimages-1210621666.jpg><p id=e0y2asmdqG- data-wc=27>Between 2018 and 2020, Roman dated Swiss scientist <a class=hm-link href=#>Anne-Sophie Flury</a>. The couple, who met on the dating app Tinder, split after three years during the COVID-19 lockdown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5d5d1c81ec8f-romankemp6432863811524742288211993125466485072994n.jpg><p id=eiXu7Coxgsj data-wc=63>During their relationship, the lovebirds welcomed a family addition in the form of a sweet Chihuahua pup called Luna. The duo even went Instagram official, with Roman sharing a handful of smitten pictures over on his grid. Following Roman's exit from the <a class=hm-link href=#>I'm a Celeb</a> jungle, Anne-Sophie proudly showed up to support her beau as they headed back to the UK.</p><h2>Lottie Moss</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/650bb1213a35-gettyimages-1165177484.jpg><p id=eYbfzjE2EnG data-wc=32>Roman has also been linked to Kate Moss's influencer sister, Lottie Moss. Neither Roman nor Lottie have commented on their alleged romance, and they haven't been seen together since rumours started swirling.</p><h2>What has Roman said about his dating life?</h2><p id=e7Wc7lGH2AVb data-wc=44>During a candid chat on the podcast, Roman spoke about his love life and explained how he is particularly attracted to independent women.&nbsp;<strong>"Women that have their life plan and are busier, that attracts me more than anything,"&nbsp;</strong>he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/74812a8ed9b6-roman-kemp.jpg><p id=e05n_j4ovRGM data-wc=26>"You look at the girls I've dated in the past, they're girls that are doing their own thing and they're [expletive] good at it," Roman added.</p><p id=eNsu5oso6djN data-wc=49>Musing on his dating preferences, the radio DJ went on to say: "It's one of the reasons, to be totally honest with you, that I don't really date English girls, ever. I love someone not knowing what I do for a living. I love someone not caring at all."</p><p id=eGkGgBOkwx data-wc=96>Roman has been open about his hopes to settle down with someone and start a family, explaining: "Family is the most important thing to me. My biggest fear in life is never being able to have kids. I think a lot of guys won't admit it, and I'm even too scared to go to the doctors and get my sperm checked, as I almost don't want to know. I would adopt kids, I would do whatever to have a family. I think the reason we're here on this planet is to make other good human beings.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!

List, 24, was wearing a black tank top and jeans while her beau, 22, looked equally casual in his shorts and t-shirt. The two kept exchanging kisses while walking on the sidewalk after brunch.</p><p>Rumors of their romance had been swirling after the <a href=#>Play Beauty</a> founder shared a series of snuggled-up photos in honor of Bertrand’s birthday on March 7. Then, the two walked the red carpets at both the Critics’ Choice Awards on March 13 and the Vanities: A Night for Young Hollywood party on March 23. The duo confirmed their romance later that month.</p><p class=p1>“You know what, I think he’s befriended my brother [<strong>Spencer List</strong>] and they’ve always been friends,” <a href=#>the&nbsp;<i>Jessie&nbsp;</i>alum exclusively told&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;</i>on Saturday, April 9 at the Kids’ Choice Awards. “And so, I think that he understands that.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “If I don’t have my family’s [approval], then the person’s done because it’s just in my head and I can’t do it. … Yeah, and I’ve not trusted them in the past and then I’ve always been wrong. They know what’s best.”</p><p>One day after their casual, PDA-filled outing, the pair walked the PaleyFest red carpet at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles. While they posed with their arms around each other, there was no smooching at the professional event. Instead, they were focused on promoting their new season of Cobra Kai.</p><p>“Fans can expect lots of fights. I take my shirt off at some point this season, and I can’t say anymore! I’m gonna get in trouble,” Betrand laughed while describing the fifth season on The Paley Center for Media’s official Instagram.</p><p>“Season 5 is even bigger. The finale is so intense,” the <a href=#>27 Dresses</a> alum told the Paley Center’s Instagram. “I am just so excited for everyone to see it. It goes into so many directions you wouldn’t even expect. People come up to me all the time with fan theories and they’re amazing, but it’s something you really wouldn’t expect, I’m really excited.”</p><p>List also revealed that it’s “been so fun” to work alongside her boyfriend, telling <a href=#>Page Six</a>, “I feel like we’re all best friends and getting to have, like, a person that I really love in the same city – I’m just so grateful for him.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added, “He’s the nicest person. But it is weird [on set], because I feel like we’re with everyone but each other on the show.”</p><p>Scroll down for more photos from the couple’s delightful day out:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksLCu0ZpkpJmZqHqxsditpqdlnJ7AtXnAp5tmopGYvKN5wZ6praqRo7FuvMCcomannmLBqbGMqZuaZaCdvLW70mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

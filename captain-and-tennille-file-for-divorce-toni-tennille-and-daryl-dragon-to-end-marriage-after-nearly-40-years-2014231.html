"I don't know why she filed," he said, adding that they are still living together. "I gotta figure it out for myself first."</p><p>Dragon and Tennille toured with the Beach Boys, as keyboardists, in the '70s. They later began touring as a duo, and released their first album, Love Will Keep Us Together, in 1975. Some of their hit tracks include: "Do That To Me One More Time," "Muskrat Love," and "The Way I Want To Touch You."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In a September 2010 <a href=#>blog post</a>, Tennille announced that Dragon suffered from a neurological condition similar to Parkinson's that caused tremors and made it difficult for him to play keyboards. "Some days he does pretty wellâ€¦. other days his playing is severely compromised," she wrote.</p><p>Captain & Tennille's <a href=#>website</a> was recently updated with a message about their split. "Until Thursday, January 16th, 2014, when Toni Tennile met with a DIVORCE ATTORNEY, in Phoenix, AZ, everything relating to THE CAPTAIN & TENNILLE appeared to the public as them being the ideal model for a 'rock-solid' married pair," the statement read. "But almost all people naturally evolve over time, & sometimes hidden feelings start to be uncovered when one may read, just a little more into (the popularized, substitute heading appearing just below), stating, for instance: 'MUSIC HAS KEPT THEM TOGETHER.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqaqKSWtq95wKebZqyVo7uquMueZJ%2BhnJp6p7vRZpuirp%2BnsKZ506ilomWkmruvtculnGaZnpl6pa3RsqNmnKKWtLC6jK2mZp2emXqurdGroJqflWKup8DEq2SnnZGnubp5k2lksp2Rp8Bufo9qa2trYQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

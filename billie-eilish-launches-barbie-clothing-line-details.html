The collection also includes tank tops, hats, necklaces and stickers.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The collection isn’t the only Barbie-themed project Eilish has worked on in promotion of the flick. She unveiled her self-directed video for “What Was I Made For,” a single from the Barbie soundtrack, on Thursday too. In the clip, Eilish — who went blonde for the visual — could be seen sorting through a rack of Barbie clothes made to look like outfits the singer has worn on red carpets in real life.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Billie-Eilish-Launches-Barbie-Collection-01.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Billie-Eilish-Launches-Barbie-Collection-02.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Eilish announced the video’s release via Instagram and opened up about how the track came about.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“In January, Greta showed me and <strong>Finneas</strong> a handful of some unfinished scenes from the film … We had noooo idea what to expect at ALL … We were so deeply moved,” Eilish wrote via Instagram. “That next day, we were writing and COULDN’T shut up about it lolll anddddddddd ended up writing almost the entire song that night.

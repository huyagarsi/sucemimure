He’s always done all of these things. So Emmy actually said, ‘Todd, just do anything you want because I know it’ll be greater than I could ever dream.'”</p><h2>Emmy Medders rose to prominence when her connection with Chase Chrisley became public.</h2><p>Emmy Medders was born on November 1, 1995, thus she will be 26 years old in 2022.

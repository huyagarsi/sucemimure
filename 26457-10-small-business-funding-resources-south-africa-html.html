Which are these sources, and what do they offer?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/35c6c57309738ec1.jpg><p class=align-left>South Africa is, without a doubt, one of the top-ranking economies in Africa, making it ideal for small business startups. This partly explains the large number of institutions offering one or more forms of financial assistance to small businesses.</p><h2>How to get small business funding in South Africa</h2><p class=align-left>Here is where to get funding for a small business in South <a href=#>Africa</a>.</p><h3>1. DTI funding for small business</h3><p class=align-left>Are you looking for small business funding from the South African government? One of the best options to consider is the DTI fund. It is a collection of funding schemes that the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) makes available to South Africans with new business ventures and those with already existing ones.</p><p class=align-left>Much of the funding schemes take the form of loans and grants, with a few being set up as cost-sharing incentives.</p><p class=align-left>Some of the options under the DTI fund include the Agro-Processing Support Scheme (APSS), Automotive Investment Scheme (AIS), Business Process Services (BPS), Support Program for Industrial Innovation (SPII), the Critical Infrastructure Program (CIP), and the Manufacturing Investment Programme (MIP).</p><p class=align-left>Those seeking <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DTI funding</a> for a small business can begin their applications by visiting the department's official website.</p><h3>2. NYDA Grant Program</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/0136a8eb26ace140.jpg><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>NYDA</a> (National Youth Development Agency) Grant Programme is designed to provide young entrepreneurs with an opportunity to access both financial and non-financial business development support to enable them to establish or grow their businesses.</p><p class=align-left>Besides the financial assistance, the non-financial services provided by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the NYDA</a> include mentoring, cooperative development, business management programmes, and consultancy services.</p><p class=align-left>The maximum amount of funding for a small business one can receive in a single cycle is R250,000.</p><h3>3. Bank and SACCO loans</h3><p class=align-left>When trying to figure out how to get funding for a <a href=#>small business</a>, banks and SACCOs almost always come to mind. There are numerous South African SACCOs and banks that offer loans to individuals and SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises).</p><p class=align-left>The likes of Nedbank, Standard Bank, and FirstRand bank limited offer capital to entrepreneurs who have worthwhile ideas with promising futures.</p><p class=align-left>Still, there are criteria that each of these financial institutions has laid down. Any applicant <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">seeking funding</a> must meet these requirements. One of the biggest drawbacks for small business owners is usually the significantly high interest rates that these SACCOs and banks charge.</p><p class=align-left>Some might also require some form of collateral before processing the loans.</p><h3>4. Small Enterprise Finance Agency (SEFA)</h3><p class=align-left>This agency was set up to foster the establishment and growth of Small and Medium Enterprises. SEFA provides <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">development finance</a> to SMEs and Cooperatives that are not able to attract commercial credit.</p><p class=align-left>SEFA grants, loans, and other forms of business development financing range between R50,000 and R5 million.</p><h3>5. Isivande Women's Fund (IWF)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/a653d719d7ef39f4.jpg><p class=align-left>This is one of the South African government's financial assistance schemes. It is an exclusive fund that aims to accelerate women's economic empowerment by providing more affordable, usable, and responsive finance than is currently available. The IWF is targeted at businesses that are wholly or majorly women-owned.</p><p class=align-left>The fund provides financing ranging from R30,000 to R2 million. An individual or business seeking the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Isivande Women's Fund</a> begins by making an application that fund managers review before the funds can be released.</p><h3>6. Khula Enterprise Finance</h3><p class=align-left>Khula is a South African state-owned enterprise that was established in 1996 to focus on promoting and developing small and medium enterprises (SMEs). While the body does not give out loans and grants directly, it makes it possible for deserving individuals and enterprises to get funding from other South African financial institutions.</p><p class=align-left>Besides providing government <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">small business funding</a>, the body also provides mentorship to entrepreneurs, helping them to manage their businesses successfully.</p><h3>7. South African Micro Finance Apex Fund</h3><p class=align-left>This fund is under the South African Ministry of Economic Development. The body provides <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">financial services</a> to small-scale entrepreneurs living in rural and outer urban areas. It does not lend directly to business owners and instead links with existing institutions in the community to help the business owners access funds.</p><p class=align-left>The South African Micro Finance Apex Fund facilitates access to three <a href=#>financial products</a>, namely the micro-credit fund, the capacity-building fund, and the savings mobilization fund.</p><h3>8. Black Business Supplier Development Programme</h3><p class=align-left>This is another funding program under the South African Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). It was designed to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">offer grants</a> in a cost-sharing scheme to black-owned businesses (both startup and existing). Most black-owned companies with a significant representation of black managers on their management team qualify for the grant.</p><p class=align-left>The fund provides grants up to a maximum of R1 million. Here is how each grant is structured.</p><ul><li>80% for tools, machinery, and equipment on a half-half cost-sharing basis.</li><li>20% for business development and training interventions.</li></ul><h3>9. The Umsobomvu Youth Fund</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/7098b6804edce96b.jpg><p class=align-left>This fund was initially designed to help South African youth set up, expand, and develop their businesses by providing financing and teaching them essential business skills.

These investors typically focus more on startups instead of established businesses.</li><li><strong>Crowdfunding: </strong>This is a financing method that sources funds from a pool of interested investors.

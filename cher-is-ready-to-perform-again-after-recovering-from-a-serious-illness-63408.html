She was forced to halt her Dressed to Kill concert tour last November after contracting a potentially fatal virus that affected her kidneys and threatened her heart.</p><p><a href=#>RELATED: Fashion Icon: Cher Named New Face of Marc Jacobs’ Upcoming Collection</a></p><p>But after taking time off and seeing some of the best medical experts around (she’s even gone to Germany to try new treatments), “the doctors have given her a clean bill of health,” an insider reveals to Closer. “Cher is doing amazing. She says she’s back on top, feeling healthy and ready to get back to work.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cher-3.jpg><p>Cher at the 58th Annual Academy Awards in 1986.</p><p>Cher announced her return to health with a triumphant appearance at the Met Gala in NYC in May as <strong>Marc Jacobs</strong>’ date, and now there are even indications that she will head back out on tour. “Going to rehearse with dancers. I’m so happy to see them,” Cher said in June. “Haven’t seen anyone since before the hospital!” The insider confirms that Cher is raring to go: “She feels like she got a second chance. She says she’s 100 percent better and she can’t wait to get back on the road.”</p><p>After fighting the virus that nearly killed her, though, Cher has reevaluated her workaholic tendencies. “Her health scare really made her think about life,” says the insider. “Cher has made her life very simple. What makes her happy now is traveling, good friends and great food. Cuba is next on her list.”</p><p>To read the full story on Cher, pick up the new issue of ‘Closer Weekly’ on newsstands now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e8KhnKtlmah6s7HAnbBmrJ9ivaa%2BxaippmWRnK6quoyana2domK%2Fpq%2FOr5yroZ6ceqe%2BzqZkmmWjmr%2Bqu9SsZKKknKOytL%2BMb2ptaGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

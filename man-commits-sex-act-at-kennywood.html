They have his DNA and are working to identify him.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kennywood-park-pittsburgh-perv.png alt="Kennywood Park Pittsburgh Perv" width=900 height=539 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to the <a href=#>Kennywood website</a>, the venue is “Pittsburgh’s Best Amusement Park For Kids and Families.” And while incidents such as these are unfortunately difficult to protect against, the parents of the victim are upset with the way the park handled it.</p><p>After the incident the girl told the ride operator what had happened. For some reason, the operator then allowed the two on the ride. As the victim’s mom noted, “They should have said, ‘Stay here, I’m going to call security.’ Security should’ve took her to their office, and then the police should have been called immediately.”</p><p>In response to the incident Kennywood released the following statement:</p><p>Like everyone, we at Kennywood are shocked by the incident that occurred Monday night. We would like to express our&nbsp;<span class="vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default"><span class=vm-hook>support</span></span>&nbsp;for the victim and her family.</p><p>We have been working with West Mifflin Police since the initial reports on Monday evening and will continue to cooperate with the authorities to the best of our abilities. West Mifflin Police have informed us that our Ride Operators and Public Safety Officers responded quickly, and handled the incident and preliminary investigation appropriately. We will continue to work with WMPD however we can. They have asked us to not comment further as this is an ongoing investigation. The most important thing is that this person be brought to justice. We thank the public for their help in identifying the suspect, and hope he is apprehended soon.</p><p>Anyone with information about this crime should contact the <a href=#>West Mifflin Police Department</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyurc1mmqilnZ7BtHnSnq9mmZOpeqLAjKScp6aprLywsA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

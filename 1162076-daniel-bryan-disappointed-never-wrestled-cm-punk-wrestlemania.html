And also, in the back of my mind I’m always – even after I left I always had this thing where, it just seemed to me that there’s always been a WrestleMania match between CM Punk and Daniel Bryan.</p><p>But, now at this point, he may be passed that. And I know he’s not big on people putting his name out there and saying, ‘I want to do this,’ and that’s not where I’m coming from at all. But, just in the back of my head I was always disappointed we never got a CM Punk vs. Daniel Bryan WrestleMania match.</p><p>Yes, although it would be very interesting because our ideas on how things work are vastly different. So, yeah, I think it would very much confuse the country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBvaWlvZmKxorrInqNmmqKurq95w6KqmqigpLavwMSdZKedppq%2FbsPRnqqtpJWZeqS5jKmsp6NdrL%2Bmv9OlnKaZnp6u</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

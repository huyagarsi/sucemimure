More than once, she said on social media that she’d been hurt a lot of narcissistic, abusive people.</p><p>Now, thankfully things are quite different&nbsp;with her new boyfriend, and she proclaims&nbsp;her love for him in public.</p><p>‘He thinks he soooo cute! 🙄😒 He really is tho 😩🤗😍 and sweet, smart, talented, charismatic and overall just an amazing man. In the past I’ve used the words “best friend” very loosely while speaking of my ex’s but I can honestly say I feel like this man really is my BEST FRIEND! We talk for hours, he makes me a better person, he listens to me and understands me. He also came into my life at a time where I’ve had enough of the narcissistic, cheating and abuse I’ve endured over the years from my previous relationships…..’ Amber wrote.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BtKpzSigkeP/</p><p>She continued and explained: ‘Me always apologizing for things I had no business apologizing for, being gaslighted, manipulated and mentally abused 😔 I felt so damaged when I met him and pushed him away in the beginning, he has talked me through everything while simultaneously loving me and working with me so I could overcome my fear of loving someone in the healthiest way again. So @ae4president Thank you for all of ur love and support baby. I love you so much. 😘🤗🥰😇’</p><p>Her followers appreciated what she has at the moment, but some people also slammed her for changing men to quickly.</p><p>Someone said ‘He’s your man until you find another one, you don’t even know the definition of a good man because you ain’t had no man besides dating KIDS.. I don’t see any change you’re still the same 🤷🏿‍♀️💯’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BsWlv9wAaK9/</p><p>One fan defended Amber and gushed over her happiness: ‘That’s because he’s a REAL man @amberrose . My man is my best friend too because he does everything your man does for you. You deserve to be with someone who brightens your day just by a one word text. Who will make you WANT to be a better person. Who will support you no matter what. I have been following you for years, & I am so happy that you’re happy. God bless 🙏🏻😘😍♥️’</p><p>Amber was in the spotlight recently again after she revealed <a href=#>she used to be a drug dealer</a>.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>She revealed recently that she tried her hand at drug dealing in the streets of Philly.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRoq%2BmvoyrpqydXaW%2ForXSnqpmoJWneq%2Bx1makmqZdlrO1sdFmm5qsmaO0brrAq5qiq6OewLW%2FjJyfnpmkmr%2B0ecCnm2aZkqrApr7SZmlscWdlhHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

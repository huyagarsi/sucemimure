Miller on Oct. 1 in Philipsburg, Mont., a clerk for Granite County confirms to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong>. A source says the "I dos" took place at the Ranch at Rock Creek.</p><p>Speculation about the 30-year-old actress' marital status reached an all-time high this week, when&nbsp;The New York Post's <a href=#>Page Six</a>&nbsp;reported&nbsp;that the couple had wed in&nbsp;"a very intimate ceremony after the birth of their daughter." (They welcomed baby girl Rose Dorothy in early September.) A source told the site that they "kept the wedding a big secret because they both wanted privacy."</p><p>That report added fuel to the fire sparked by Johansson's Nov. 18 appearance at the 2nd Annual Champions of Rockaway Hurricane Sandy Benefit in New York City, where she was spotted with a thin, diamond-studded band below her eye-catching engagement ring.</p><p>A rep for the Avengers: Age of Ultron actress first confirmed her engagement in September 2013, about six months before news of her pregnancy broke in March. She remained mum on their plans for a wedding, vaguely telling WSJ. Magazine that they would "get married at some point."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier in March, she <a href=#>told Access Hollywood</a> she was taking a very laid-back approach to her nuptials. "Oh, I don't plan anything," she said. "I'm terrible at planning. I'm not gonna plan anything â€” I like to wing it!"</p><p>Johansson was previously married to <strong><a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a></strong> from 2008 to 2011. He wed <strong><a href=#>Blake Lively</a></strong> in 2012; they're now expecting their first child together.</p><p>A rep for Johansson has not yet responded to a request for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKCsZaOYrrO4xK2rZqKfna6vv9KopWaZnKeyorDYZqSaqqKesqV506hkq6edlravecOarKuhkZh6c3yQbWhqag%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

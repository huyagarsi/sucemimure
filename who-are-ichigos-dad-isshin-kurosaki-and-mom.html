These two individuals hail from two distinct clans that are at loggerheads with each other, but the power of love brought them together. Ichigo’s father, Isshin Kurosaki nee Shiba, belongs to a class of spiritual beings known as Shinigami or soul reapers.</p><p>They help human souls transition to the afterlife upon their death. If a soul is evil in nature, i.e., a Hollow, they help to change the soul for the better before sending him or her to the afterlife.</p><p>Ichigo’s mom, Masaki Kurosaki, belongs to the Quincy race, a clan of human beings with heightened spiritual abilities who play the same role as the soul reapers. The only difference between the two is that while the soul reapers want to see the redemption of the Hollows, the Quincies out rightly kill them. Such a difference in modus operandi put a sharp division between the two groups, and they became mortal enemies.</p><p>Such mortal enmity couldn’t come between Ichigo’s parents, though. The duo first encountered each other as young adults. Ichigo’s father had come down to the human world in pursuit of a Hollow, and during the battle, the Hollow gained the upper hand until Masaki intervened and saved Isshin. He was quite taken with her and never forgot her, even after returning to the spirit realm.</p><p>Isshin later came back to earth only to discover that Masaki was in grave danger of becoming a Hollow. He decided to sacrifice his Shinigami powers so that she could repress the hollow nature in her and leave a normal life.</p><p>Having made that sacrifice, Isshin couldn’t go back to the spirit realm. He remained with humans and set up a clinic, and became a doctor. He and Masaki also got married and welcomed three kids, a son named Ichigo and two daughters, namely Karin Kurosaki and Yuzu Kurosaki.</p><h2><strong>How Strong is Ichigo’s Dad?</strong></h2><p>Ichigo’s dad, Isshin Kurosaki, may have spent the remainder of his life as an ordinary small-town doctor tending to his patients, but he is so much more than that. Ichigo’s dad was an exceptionally strong Shinigami during his time as a soul reaper, and he was so good that he eventually rose to become the captain of the 10th division of the soul reapers.</p><p>During his time as a soul reaper, Ichigo’s dad was a master swordsman with a fearsome weapon known as Engetsu. He was equally skilled in hand-to-hand combat and boasted several lethal fighting styles such as Chōhigezutsuki, Oni Dekopin, Isshin Flying Double Knee, hunpo Expert: Hakuda Expert. Ichigo’s dad also boasts of heightened strength, perceptibility, endurance, durability, and spiritual awareness. All this made many afraid to go up against him.</p><p>Ichigo’s dad is so strong that he could send his enemies, such as Aizen, flying backward with a simple flick of his fingers. Even after so many years of being in retirement, he was still able to assist his son in his fights against the likes of Aizen and Grand Fisher. He eventually killed grand fisher, the man that killed his beloved Masaki.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ichigo's mom is raw. Now we know why Ichigo is the goat he is. He most definitely got some of it from her ???? <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/obVVnlpu9l</a></p><p>— ???????????????????????????????????????????????? ♨️ (@trapmagenta) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">July 6, 2020</a></p><h2><strong>Who Is Ichigo’s Mom?</strong></h2><p>Ichigo’s mom is Masaki Kurosaki, who died when he was nine years old. Ichigo’s mom belongs to the Quincy race and nearly became a Hollow following an attack. She was able to repress her Hollow nature with the help of her husband, Isshin Kurosaki, and they lived a happy life for many years.</p><p>She was, however, killed by Grand Fisher, but the person that was actually behind her death was Yhwach, the progenitor of the Quincy race. In his selfish plan to extend his life and his own powers, Yhwach stole Masaki’s powers, and as such, she wasn’t able to fight Grand Fisher.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaqaG2r7HRZ5qopV%2BstbB5wKucZqGTnbaou9Jmm5qcXZ7AtLTIp2SkraKkwKK3yGaYp5xdoryuew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

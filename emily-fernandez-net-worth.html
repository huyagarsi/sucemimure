You are such a sweet, kind, thoughtful and responsible little lady.”</strong></p><p>Her second child&nbsp;was born on April 27, 2016, a son named&nbsp;Lontel Jahnar ”JJ” Johnson, Jr.</p><p>The father is&nbsp;Lontel Johnson.

He was born on April 27, 2016, and he was the perfect tiny package.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>She later added:</p><p><strong>”My baby was having seizures in utero and doctors believe there was a problem with the placenta. Little people pregnancies are high risk and being pregnant with a little person is even more dangerous. He wasn’t receiving enough oxygen and he was born with blood around his brain.”</strong></p><p>In another interview, Emily said:</p><p><strong>“I fought for his life – I demanded that he have multiple tests run. I wanted to be sure that I did everything in my power to save him and keep him. If he would’ve been average height, this would’ve still happened.”</strong></p><p>Emily went on to say:</p><p><strong>”Everything was due to his brain damage.”</strong></p><p>In March 2018, it was reported that Emily is expecting her 2nd son through IVF with Lontel.</p><p>In an Instagram post featuring a very pregnant Fernandez, alongside pal Bri Barlup, the mom-to-be wrote:</p><p><strong>“This was 3 months ago. Just imagine how things are now.”</strong></p><p>According to some sources, the couple is not currently together; however, Lontel Johnson plans to be involved in the baby’s life.</p><p>On November 3, 2018, she gave birth to Zayne Odell Johnson in Dallas.</p><p>Despite being born at just over 35 weeks, the boy was a healthy 6 pound, 1-ounce newborn.

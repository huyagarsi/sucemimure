For a match with so little on the line, it held so much value.</p><p>Prior to the past few weeks this match lacked the typical hype that fans had become accustomed to following two outstanding Mania bouts with WWE Hall-of-Fame inductee&nbsp;Shawn Michaels.</p><p>What Triple H and Taker could not make up for with in-ring prowess, they more than matched in psychology and story-telling. &nbsp;From a story-telling perspective, Triple H took the Undertaker to a truly career-defining match on wrestling's grandest stage.</p><p>It wasn't a technical masterpiece. Instead of trying to replicate the magic of HBK-Taker from the years prior WrestleManias, Triple H and Taker set out to forge a new and defining legacy in the squared-circle.</p><p>They did not disappoint as these two titans clashed over the Undertaker's Mania Streak. &nbsp;The story was about Triple H's desire to be "the one."&nbsp; This was sold very well by a returning Jim Ross, who has always had a knack for creating a narrative in big matches.</p><p>Triple H took the Taker to the limits, utilizing tables, chairs and even the Undertaker's signature "tombstone pile-driver" in attempts to slay the "Dead man."</p><p>As Triple H pleaded for Taker to "stay down," one could feel a change in the air. &nbsp;For once the Undertaker was the prey at WrestleMania. He was weak, exposed and showed his age. &nbsp;The Taker looked like a legend near the end of his road, kept alive by a winning streak that will never be duplicated.</p><p>As Triple H sought to finish the Taker with the trademark sledgehammer, a desperate Undertaker caught "the Game" in the "Devil's Triangle" submission. This trademark maneuver, a gogoplata&nbsp;choke hold, kept "the Game" off guard and sealed another impressive victory for the "Dead man."</p><p>Unlike prior WrestleMania victories, there would be no celebration. No crowd-pleasing pose before an awe-inspired audience. Instead, the loser would walk awayâ€”the winner left laying on his back before being carried out on a stretcher. &nbsp;The final chapter had been written. &nbsp;</p><p>While time will tell whether the Undertaker will return, in his victory to attain 19-0, he may have given the last of who he is. &nbsp;Triple H may not have ended the streak, but in his attempt he may have ended the career of the Undertaker.</p><p>The Winner: Undertaker via submission</p><p><strong>What it Means: Triple H and Taker defined their careers in a truly memorable match. In what may have been his final stand, the Undertaker leaves WrestleMania battered, broken...and undefeated.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJobW5rZ2d%2BbsPRnqqtpJWirq%2B1wGZpcGWUmrOqusinnmaZnmKys60%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

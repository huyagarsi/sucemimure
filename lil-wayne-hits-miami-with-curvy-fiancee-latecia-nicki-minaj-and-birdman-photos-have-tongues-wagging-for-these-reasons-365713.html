The plus-size model has been flaunting her massive ring for months, and there were rumors that she was engaged, but now it is official.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8DtqCxJTHU/</p><p>The rap star and his future wife have many on social media talking about her shape if she is pregnant and his hair.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8DnjNbhNla/</p><p>One person had this to say: “She’s the sweetest and most beautiful girl love her 😍. Plus-size model… I love to see it. By the way, she’s average and normal size, especially for that height Y’all get so used to seeing perfect bodies y’all forget what real ones look like 🤦🏻‍♀️😩.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu-sSDGAQ81/</p><p>A backer stated: “She is beautiful 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 one of my favs 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾That one dread hanging on like some of y’all baby daddies this tax season. Don’t think we’ve EVER seen these locs retwisted…which is puzzling. It’s like why take on such a style to let them get to THIS.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7_eebFHe1R/</p><p>This social media user stated: “Lil Wayne’s girlfriend is not thick. At all. She is a big girl that has big belly thighs just like any other big girl. You actually proved my point. I guarantee if she was black, there would be a bunch of comments saying she’s too big and that Wayne could do better. I’ve seen it happen plenty of times. Wayne, please cut them locs OFF…”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8DfANnlJQ2/</p><p>A critic revealed this: “I just want to know what’s up with these celebs not being with black women. Are we really that bad? Lol. I just wanna clip that little dread hanging. 😂”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8Dt6CIHktF/</p><p>This defender stepped in to say the following: “Y’all mad he chose someone outside his race but forgot he’s been dating black women, our black queens, for years. I think at this point if he’s happy we should be happy for him. 🤷🏾‍♀️”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Lil Wayne is ready to be more public with his new relationship.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGecnrluw8CypZ5lmJ7BtHnMopimoV2strW0jJysq66pYrOqrc2cnJ5lnJbBpq%2FImmSnoZOgtm65yKeYo2WRo7Fursirm6aZnmK9qbvTqKpmoJGrsm7Azqeerp2jYsSis8aipaBllqS%2FbsDHnqqeZaKarrS7zaxkbG5lbH50ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

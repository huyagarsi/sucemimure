Ethanol toxicity has been directly connected to her alcohol consumption. With this revelation, her death was officially ruled an “accident.”</p><p><strong>Trending Today:</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a href=#>Family of Model Found Dead In Downtown Los Angeles Says She Was Discovered with Leg Up In ‘Gruesome’ Scene Days After Telling Friends That She Was Going on Date</a><br></strong></li><li><strong><a href=#>Texas Security Guard Hurles a Slew of Racial Slurs At Black Woman In Video Before Allegedly Spitting on Her In Dispute Over Broken Car Mirror</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Councilwoman’s Husband Steps In As White Mayor Berates Her In Public Meeting for Asking a Question: “Quiet!

When they arrived, they received no response but returned about two hours later after receiving a call reporting the discovery of a body at the residence.</p><p>The woman’s father, Guy Coats, and an aunt, May Stevens, came to identify her body and saw her in the bed with her arm “extended out” from a cover. Guy Coats identified her by her tattoos.</p><p>“She had a cover over her, and I touched her arm, but her whole body was swollen like it was inflamed,” the dad said in an<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> interview</a> with KTLA.</p><p>“I took a look at her face, and I immediately turned away because I just couldn’t take it,” he continued. “I knew immediately that she had already passed away. I couldn’t look too long and had to turn away, but I saw her fingers were starting to blacken on the tips.”</p><p>Guy Coats said he suspected someone murdered his daughter after police discovered another model dead from “homicidal violence” — three miles away from her apartment. His belief was fueled by how he said her body looked, saying he observed it being “busted,”&nbsp; “swollen,” and “unrecognizable.”</p><p>“I believe it was murder, I really do. That’s not somebody who just laid in their bed and died,” he said.</p><p>May Stevens, the woman’s aunt, also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a> KTLA that Nichole was discovered with one of her legs up.</p><p>Despite the father’s assertion and the family’s chagrin, the Los Angeles Police Department stated<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> that there was no connection</a> between the deaths of the two women.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for&nbsp;ATLANTA BLACK STAR’S free daily newsletters&nbsp;to stay up-to-date on the latest developments, from top news headlines to celebrity news.</strong></a></p><p>Sharon Coats, Nichole’s mother, was one of the first voices to say the police were too quick to move on.</p><p>“It’s like they don’t care. I’m not going to let this be a cold case.

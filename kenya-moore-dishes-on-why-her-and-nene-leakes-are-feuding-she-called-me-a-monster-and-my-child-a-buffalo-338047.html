Kenya appeared on the Wendy Williams Show where she dished on the root of their feud.</p><p>Wendy, who is now besties with Nene, made it clear that although Leakes is her friend — she has always liked Moore. She explained that the beauty queen deserves everything that she’s getting.</p><p>While on the couch, Williams got straight to the point and asked why Kenya and Nene don’t like each other.</p><p>The mother of one explained that at one time — she thought they were friends.</p><p>‘You know what, I like people that are genuine and I think, through the years, I’ve felt like I was a friend once we got over our little hump. Then, that turned into something different.’</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/B4fRNjKBV6n/</a></p><p>She went on to explain how the Glee alum wasn’t there for her during the time she needed friends the most.</p><p>‘When I had a high-risk pregnancy, that I wanted my entire life, she never once called me. When I did show up, she never checked on my child, she never said, ‘Is everything ok?’ When I wasn’t going to be on the show, she never said, ‘Hey are you ok, girl? Do you need anything?”</p><p>She also referenced the way Nene acted when she showed up to Cynthia’s event last season.</p><p>‘And then, when she did see me eight months pregnant, she called me a ‘monster’ and said my child was a ‘buffalo’ and was throwing insults. It was all on TV. She made such a big deal about us not being friends, but she’s the one who’s not friends with people.’</p><p>Additionally, Kenya spilled tea that Kandi Burruss is the highest-paid on the show making her the true queen of RHOA.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>She also confirmed the rumors that <a href=#>Leakes tried to spit on her</a>.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebmru6rYympqiqlWKxqr%2FHnqpmp55ixKnFjKGcq2WRo7FuusSnnGaklZa4pr%2BMmqmeZZaawqW1zaBkrKCVYrCiuMuem2allWKubrnOp6qtnaJirq%2BwjKawZpuYnrmlecBmma6elpa5sHmSbG9pbGdk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Stewart stars at the promiscuous Marylou, the 16-year-old wife of Dean Moriarty (<strong>Garrett Hedlund</strong>) in the Walter Salles adaptation of Jack Kerouac’s classic beat generation novel.</p><p>But Stewart insists that her sex scenes in the film with <a href=#><strong>Kirsten Dunst</strong></a>‘s real-life boyfriend Hedlund, 28, didn’t intimidate her — it was their dancing scene that did.</p><p>“The dancing scene was so much more terrifying than any of the sex scenes were for me. I was so scared of it,” she explains in a new interview with <a href=#>IndieWire</a>. “We crammed, I think, 60 extras into a tiny little room. Literally, I could feel the floor vibrating. It was so f–king cool. But I was terrified.”</p><p>When asked what it’s like watching herself have sex on screen, Stewart says, “Well, I wasn’t really having sex.”</p><p>“To be honest, I think if you were to isolate the scenes, it’s fairly ridiculous watching yourself fake have sex,” she added. “But within the movie, watching the movie, I do get so caught up in this one. I’ve seen it three times, and that’s not typical for me.”</p><p>Stewart is also looking forward to watching herself in the sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="kristen stewart" width=467 height=387 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Though she said she’s not allowed to talk about it, Stewart shared, “It’s gonna be f–kin’ amazing. No, I’m so excited about it, it’s crazy.”</p><p>But she added, “The other day I said that there was a strong possibility that we’re going to make a sequel, and that’s very true, but everyone was like, ‘Whoa, stop talking about it.’ So no, I’m totally not allowed to talk about it.”</p><p>Despite the <a href=#>controversy</a> surrounding the first Snow White film (Stewart was <a href=#>caught cheating with her married director</a>, <strong>Rupert Sanders</strong>, in July), the actress is completely on board to film the proposed sequel, and loves the plot suggestions (that she’s not allowed to discuss.)</p><p>“Oh my God. F–k, yeah. Absolutely,” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In August, <a href=#>Deadline</a> reported that one plot option being discussed was a spinoff starring<strong> <a href=#>Chris Hemsworth</a></strong>, reprising his role as the Huntsman. And it is still unknown if the rumored sequel will be directed again by Sanders.</p><p>Another project Stewart has in the works is Warner Bros.’s Focus, a story about two con-artists who fall in love. The actress was set to share steamy love scenes with costar <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a>, but the actor’s rep confirmed to <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> Dec. 20 that Affleck has dropped out of the film due to “scheduling conflicts.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakqpmowaa6jKyrnq%2BRp8Fuw8CtmqGhnpx6rsXSnqOfZZaWuKZ5x5qtnmWjmsVutc1mpqdlpJ2ybr7OmptmoaNiv6qwyJyspaelqHpzfJBraWppYmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

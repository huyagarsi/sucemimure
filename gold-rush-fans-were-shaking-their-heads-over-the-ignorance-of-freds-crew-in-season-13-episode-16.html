After one of the belts in Lewis’ washplant snaps, the crew (as well as Lewis’ mechanic) decided to simply reload another belt without inspecting for errors – leading to another lost belt and plenty of angry fans.</p><p dir=ltr>“So why did no one take time to look at what was causing the belt issue on Freds machine, while it was down, when one of them was away getting new belts?” wrote u/The-Scotsman_. “Why put a new belt on, have it come off, and THEN look to try to find the cause? Complete and utter muppets.” “Fred’s crew are idiots,” echoed u/BobtheReplier. U/PrestonTheCat24 observed that they were screaming at the television for somebody to check the pulleys in the washplant, and found the incompetence regarding the snapped belts to be extremely cringeworthy.</p><p dir=ltr>Although much of the criticism regarding Lewis and his crew appears to be blown out of proportion, this particular incident is certainly one to note — not only because of how it set Lewis’ crew back but because of the inherent danger of mishandling this dangerous machinery. In any case, it’s clear that the criticism of Lewis’ crew was well-deserved, and they ought to be more cautious with their machinery in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cLPOpZtmqqWotW6ywKeqZq%2BVp7Juv8eaoqKml2LBqbHIq2ShnZGZwG671Z6pZqyYmnqqs82oqZqmk5p6sLKMn6menKNisLOx1magp2Wjmq60u81maGxllaW2tLvDnmRqbl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

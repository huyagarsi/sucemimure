Celebrities are touting it. Doctors are hailing it as a research-backed breakthrough.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Its popularity has led to shortages, as people and their providers scramble to get their hands on a drug that has been shown to be incredibly effective for treating both diabetes and obesity. It’s a major medical advancement that could make a big difference.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ozempic (also known by the generic name semaglutide) was approved for use as diabetes medication in 2017. The makers of Ozempic call weight loss a ‘side effect,’ but it’s been shown in numerous research studies to be an effective option for treating the disease of obesity.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Providers can (and do) prescribe Ozempic ‘off-label’ for people who are living with obesity. Using a medication off-label means it’s prescribed for a use other than its stated purpose.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=femail-ccox>Source: </span><span class=mol-style-italic><span class=femail-ccox>Cleveland Clinic&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Constance came up with a plan to stop eating from 3pm onwards each day after finding some studies that outlined the apparent health benefits of evening fasting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I haven’t looked back. I still drink after 3pm, juice, water (alcohol if I want to but I’m not a huge drinker) or a full cream chia if I feel hungry,’ she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’ve even had a thick shake when taking the kids out for dinner and felt left out.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Even though a thick shake can be more calorie-dense than some meals, Constance said her 3pm-fasting rule was about setting herself boundaries.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘If I start thinking I can eat after 3pm but only on special occasions, I will convince myself every day is a special occasion, but I’m not going to have a thick shake lying around most nights to indulge in,’ she explained.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I know myself and I know the way my mind works and this works for me. One simple and consistent change is what has worked for me. The knowledge that I can eat whatever I want as long as it’s in a specific time frame is what has worked for me.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Constance does not restrict her eating before her 3pm cut-off, admitting to eating McDonald’s on some occasions but found she ‘naturally’ made better meal choices during the day.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She reminded fans her weight loss was about her ‘mental and physical health’.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’m not talking about the beauty industry and the unrealistic expectations of women that society is constantly pushing,’ she said.&nbsp;</p><img decoding=async id=i-29fc069bea3716f4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/06/14/05/72110481-12192271-Constance_does_not_restrict_her_eating_before_her_3pm_cut_off_ad-a-34_1686715942969.jpg height=798 width=634 alt="Constance does not restrict her eating before her 3pm cut-off admitting to eating McDonald's on some days but found she 'naturally' made better meal choices" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Constance does not restrict her eating before her 3pm cut-off admitting to eating McDonald’s on some days but found she ‘naturally’ made better meal choices</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’m talking about every day women who like me have found that being over worked or taking care of other people has gotten in the way of them taking care of themselves, whose physical and mental health need help.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The mum added she was ‘frustrated’ by the accusations about using Ozempic – not because she felt ‘judged’ or even praised for losing weight without them but because of the misconceptions about the drug.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It’s frustrating because I worry that people think these miracle injections shed kilos for anyone who tries them,’ she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Sure they’ve done wonders for some and caused health complaints and made vital medications inaccessible for others.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Constance wanted people who were thinking of trying weight loss injectables, they shouldn’t be ‘disheartened’ if they don’t work.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Don’t give up on you and your health, it’s the one thing that has to come before everything else,’ she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Being skinnier doesn’t make you happy.

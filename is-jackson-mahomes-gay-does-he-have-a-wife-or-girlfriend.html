Does He Have a Wife or Girlfriend?</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>Jackson Mahomes is not gay and does not have a girlfriend or wife at the moment. He confirmed that he is not gay on a YouTube video he made to set the record straight. “I am not gay. I am attracted to girls,” <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">he said</a></strong></p><p>The younger brother of Super-Bowl winning quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, is concentrating on growing his Tik Tok presence into becoming a major social media influencer. He has won millions of fans with his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>viral sideline dances</a> on match days but this rise to stardom has not come without controversies.</p><p>Jackson Mahomes has faced criticism for what fans term disrespectful attitude. He has also been dogged by rumors about his sexuality and gender and has received despicable messages from online trolls. All this has grated on his nerves, forcing him to publicly declare in March 2022 that he was broken and sad about the media <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>destroying</a> his life.</p><h2><strong>Is Jackson Mahomes Gay or Straight?</strong></h2><p>Jackson Mahomes&nbsp;is not&nbsp;gay and does not have a girlfriend or wife at the moment. The Tik Tok star stated so in his first YouTube video which he posted in 2021. In that video, Jackson Mahomes made it clear that he is not gay but is attracted to girls. He also pointed out that one of the reasons why people assume that he is gay was because of his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>voice</a>. Mahomes stated that he found such judgemental assumptions disrespectful. He also stated that the whole thing had made him quite insecure about his voice.</p><h3><strong>The Tik Tok Star has Suffered Homophobic Abuse Online and Offline</strong></h3><p>Despite these clarifications, many people continue to insist that Jackson Mahomes is gay and often use that as an excuse to throw abuse at him on social media. Whenever he posts something on Instagram or Twitter, many responders would reply with the word “gay”. Others would also hurl all sorts of negative abuse at him. It is a pitiable situation but something that Jackson Mahomes has had to deal with for a long time.</p><p>Back when his famous elder brother won the Super Bowl in 2020, several people took out their anger on him (Jackson) by hurling homophobic slurs at him. He was forced to respond and revealed that apart from the public comments, he got thousands of private insulting messages as well. He stated that he was considering writing to the employees of his detractors to share the message he got. He also asked people not to try to apologize after they had done some wrong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Jackson-Mahomes-1.jpg><p>It is two years down the line from then and Jackson Mahomes continues to suffer homophobic abuse occasionally. For instance, during a Kansas City Chiefs game in March 2022, he was on the sidelines recording his Tik Tok videos as usual when an unidentified fan hurled homophobic abuses at him. The abuse was a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>combination</a> of his surname with a derogatory variation of the word “homosexual” and left him so shell-shocked that he couldn’t even respond.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>a lot of people DM me hurtful things then be like “you get 1000s of DM you will never see this” like sheesh I read every dm so y’all can chilll…</p><p>— Jackson Mahomes (@jacksonmahomes) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2020</a></p><h2><strong>Is Jackson Mahomes Transgender?</strong></h2><p>Jackson Mahomes is not transgender. Any Trans rumors surrounding him may stem from the fact that he has some feminine features. For instance, the way he smiles and poses in pictures has some feminine aura which makes people assume that he is not a biological male but transitioned from female to male.</p><p>Another reason why people may think that Jackson Mahomes is transgender is his Tik Tok dances which may look girly in nature. There is also his voice which is more feminine in nature. Mahomes has previously revealed his insecurities about his voice and unfortunately, this is one of the reasons that people may assume that he is transgender.</p><p>There is however no truth to this. Jackson Mahomes is a biological male and did not transition from female to male. If he were transgender, he would come out and acknowledge the same given the fact that there are more visible role models for the trans community in recent times.</p><h2><strong>Is Jackson Mahomes Married?</strong></h2><p>Jackson Mahomes is not married but his elder brother, Patrick Mahomes, did get married to his high school sweetheart, Brittany Matthews, on the 12th of March 2022. The ceremony took place in Hawaii and Jackson Mahomes was one of the best men for his brother. It was quite a beautiful and special moment and may have inspired Jackson to consider getting married himself. For now, though, he is not married and is still on the lookout for Mrs. Right.</p><h2><strong>Who is Jackson Mahomes’ Girlfriend?</strong></h2><p>The identity of Jackson Mahomes’ girlfriend is not known. It is possible that he is not in any relationship at the moment. It is also possible that he has a girlfriend but is choosing to protect the person from the spotlight which can be intrusive and negative at times. Whatever be the reality, it is not known who Jackson Mahomes’ girlfriend is and all we are left with are media speculations.</p><h3><strong>The Tik Tok Star Has Been Linked To Fellow Influencer – Dayna Marie</strong></h3><p>In March 2022, Jackson Mahomes was romantically linked to a fellow Tik Tok star, Dayna Marie. The speculations arose after <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>TMZ</a> shared a clip of both of them kissing. The kiss didn’t last for long though before the clip came to an end. It is, therefore, possible that Dayna Marie is Jackson Mahomes’ girlfriend. This is however not confirmed and may only be a stunt that Mahomes pulled in his continuing effort to convince people that he is not gay.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/04/Jackson-Mahomes.jpg><h3><strong>He Could Also be Dating his Best friend – Amaya Ward</strong></h3><p>Another lady who can possibly be Jackson Mahomes’ girlfriend is his self-proclaimed best friend, Amaya Ward. Amaya Ward is a student journalist at Oakland University and regularly anchors news on the university’s TV channel. She and Jackson Mahomes are very good friends judging from their social media activity. They regularly retweet each other’s posts and Mahomes once tweeted that he was missing her and looking forward to having her home. Such closeness may raise the presumption that the duo may also be dating but there is no confirmation to that effect.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Really missing MY best friend right about now, and knowing she about to be home in a like a week makes me happyyy <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/9cAJMhOQjy</a></p><p>— Jackson Mahomes (@jacksonmahomes) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">September 11, 2018</a></p><h2><strong>Are Jackson Mahomes and Brittany Matthews Still Together?</strong></h2><p>Jackson Mahomes and Brittany Matthews were never together and have never dated each other. Brittany is Jackson’s sister-in-law as she is married to his famous older brother, Patrick. The two are great friends though. They attend many of Patrick’s games together and Brittany often joins Jackson on the sidelines as he records his Tik Tok videos.</p><p>Brittany also regularly appears in Jackson’s Tik Tok videos and he takes pictures and videos of her on the sidelines during most games. The two are very close and they have been inevitably caught up in some controversies. For instance, in September 2021, it was alleged that Jackson poured water on some fans at a game. Brittany was also alleged to have poured champagne on fans during a game in January 2022.</p><p>Such negative publicity led to a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>news report</a> in February 2022 in which it was claimed that Patrick Mahomes asked his brother and his partner to stop attending his games as they were tarnishing his brand. This however turned out to be false as Super Bowl quickly debunked it,<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external> tweeting</a> that people were just making up stuff these days.</p><p>That tweet clears up the air and ensures that Jackson Mahomes and Brittany Matthews will continue to be a regular fixture at Patrick Mahomes’ games. This will increase the bond between the brother-in-law and sister-in-law which is already quite strong. For instance, when a fan hurled homophobic slurs at Jackson Mahomes in January 2022, Brittany stood up for him and chided the man for being so rude.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLa0ecmamqSrn6N6rq3HqKSeq12crrp5w6icrGWYmnqprdWeZJplp56zpnnOq2SgoaKhs7O1xKebaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

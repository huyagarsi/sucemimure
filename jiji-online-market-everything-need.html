It grew with time and, at present, has turned itself into a big Nigerian free online classifieds website with an advanced security system.</p><p>Jiji’s history began with Anton Wolyansky, who also acts as the company’s CEO, and Vladimir Mnogoletniy, who also serves as a board member. In less than a decade of its existence, it has expanded to other African countries like Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Ghana; and has met over 10 million unique visitors every month and is worth ads of over $10 billion.</p><p>Coming down to Jiji Nigeria, also known as Jiji ng, the website lets people of Nigerian origin register, add products, sell, and buy products that can be delivered to them. While this is said, one may wonder how to sell products using the online marketplace and the right products to sell. One important thing with Jiji is its ability to segment products into categories. These products also come with descriptions that will help a buyer understand the features and characteristics of whatever they want to buy from a seller. Here’s a detailed way to buy and sell on Jiji Nigeria.</p><h2><strong>How Do I Sell on Jiji in Nigeria?</strong></h2><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/JIJI2-e1501596847131.png alt="jIJI App" width=771 height=900 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>One cannot sell on Jiji Nigeria except following different steps that include creating an account.

JiJi.ng will never send you emails requesting your personal details. If you receive an email asking you to provide your personal information to them, do not open any links, report the email and delete it.</p><p>Fake fee requests – Avoid anyone who asks for fees to buy or sell an item or service as &nbsp;JiJi.ng will never request any pre-payments from buyers and doesn’t allow items not located in Nigeria, so import and brokerage fees should never be required.</p><p>DO NOT accept requests to use money transfer services such as the Western Union or MoneyGram. These services are meant for transactions between people who know each other well, not for anyone, and many scams are run through them. Avoid requests to use these services.</p><p>If you happen to have any further questions or clarification, send an email to <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=71020401011e0305311b181b185f1f16>[email&nbsp;protected]</a>.

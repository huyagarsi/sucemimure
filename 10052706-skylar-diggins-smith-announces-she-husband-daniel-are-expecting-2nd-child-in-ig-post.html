She <a href=#>later said</a> she played the entire 2018 WNBA season while pregnant, a year that saw her average 17.9 points and 6.2 assists in 34.1 minutes per game. The 32-year-old missed the 2019 season while recovering from her pregnancy.</p><p>Her status for 2023 remains unclear. She's signed with the Mercury for <a href=# rel=noopener>one more year</a> and is due to earn $234,350.</p><p>Diggins-Smith, who had <a href=# rel=noopener>criticized</a> what she felt had been a lack of support from the Dallas Wings during her first pregnancy, told ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>M.A. Voepel</a> in November 2019 that she wanted to address that concern with the new collective bargaining agreement.</p><p>"I've already reached out to a few moms," she said. "As we negotiate with the CBA, how can we improve things? It's about prioritization; we can't have everything. But I'm going to bring that portion to the table because I'm a mom."</p><p>The WNBA and the Women's National Basketball Players Association <a href=# rel=noopener>signed</a> an eight-year CBA in January 2020. As part of the wide-ranging pact, players became entitled to collect their full salary while on maternity leave. They can also collect a $5,000 stipend for child care and receive "workplace accommodations that provide a comfortable, safe and private place for nursing mothers."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZWeEcYKMrKKypJGneqW1xqCgp6tdqLqqwMdmmKemn6q7pLHSZqqhnV2dwrSuwKebZpyRo7amuIyaqZ5lla29pq%2FToqWgZWKjsW6vx6KjnWWZo3qqs4yppqys</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

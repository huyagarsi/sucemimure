They’re both in Miami, and <a href=#>they’ve been spotted going to the gym together</a> and <a href=#>sunbathing on a yacht.</a> So… did they ever really break up? Sources claimed weeks ago that they broke up when Camy came to the realization that <a href=#>she kind of hated A-Rod</a>, and that they had nothing in common. Camy was then seen <a href=#>partying with Matthew Morrison</a>, amongst other dudes.</p><p>Lainey thinks it’s just a holiday hookup, and that Camy just went back for a piece. I hope so. I’ve said it before about Camy, though, and I’ll say it again: I admire her game, even if I don’t always care for her pieces. I respect that she just goes in, gets off, and leaves. So even if this is “more” than a holiday piece, I trust that Camy still isn’t THAT serious about him.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/view2.picapp.com/pictures.photo/image/9951295/new-york-yankees-third/new-york-yankees-third.jpg border=0 width=500 title="New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez stretches during practice for their American League Championship Series baseball playoff against the Texas Rangers in Arlington" height=383 oncontextmenu=return!1 ondrag=return!1 onmousedown=return!1 alt="New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez stretches during practice for their American League Championship Series baseball playoff against the Texas Rangers in Arlington, Texas October 14, 2010.

Ooh, Mr Schu! Who's that with you? Cameron Diaz is chaparoned by Joanna Garcia as she enjoys a night out with Glee's Mr Schuester, actor Matthew Morrison, at the Bardot lounge in West Hollywood. Diaz and Morrison tried to avoid being photographed together at the club's 2nd birthday bash, but Morrison did drive the ladies home. Justin Timberlake look-a-like Morrison has previously dated Kristen Bell and Kelly Brook, whilst Miss Diaz has stepped out with Alex A-Rod Rodriguez, Justin Timberlake, Matt Dillon and Jared Leto in the past.

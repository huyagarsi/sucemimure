Celebrities are just like Us — they get crushes on famous folks and can become starstruck when they see certain stars.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Amy Adams</strong></a> admitted in November 2020 that after watching old movies starring <a href=#><strong>Robert De Niro</strong></a>, including <a href=#>The Godfather</a> and The Deer Hunter, she got a “<a href=#>retroactive crush</a>” on the actor.</p><p>“Meaning, like, I have a crush on him in the ’70s,” the American Hustle actress told <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></a> at the time. “I mean, not that I wouldn’t have a crush on him now, but you know, I’m married.”</p><p>Before finding love with <a href=#><strong>Joe Jonas</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a> revealed she tried to pick up <a href=#>Friends</a> alum <a href=#><strong>Matthew Perry</strong></a>. The <a href=#>Game of Thrones</a> alum opened up about the experience in June 2019, saying that after she spotted Perry rehearsing for a play next to her house in 2016, she <a href=#>began frequenting the local grocery store nearby</a> to get a glimpse of him and make her move.</p><p>“I would walk around the corner every day and I would see Matthew Perry smoking a cigarette,” she recalled during a “#BehindTheTweets” interview with Twitter. “And I bought a lighter from Budgens [store] so that I could walk up to him and offer to light his cigarette. [Unfortunately] it was already lit, so, that was just embarrassing.”</p><p>Olympian <a href=#><strong>Simone Biles</strong></a>, on the other hand, fell hard for <a href=#><strong>Zac Efron</strong></a> well before she won a gold medal at the Rio Olympics in 2016.</p><p>Biles gushed to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in August of that year about her crush on the <a href=#>High School Musical</a> star before <a href=#>meeting him in Rio</a> weeks later while doing an interview on the Today show.</p><p>“On cloud 9 @zacefron,” the athlete captioned a GIF of herself kissing the actor on the cheek after their surprise meeting. Biles then tweeted a series of photos with the Baywatch star, writing, “He kissed me on the cheek just letting y’all know.”</p><p>Crushes are not limited to loving someone from afar. <a href=#><strong>Emma Watson</strong></a>, who played Hermione in the <a href=#>Harry Potter</a> franchise, revealed that she was smitten with her costar <a href=#><strong>Tom Felton</strong></a> (who played Draco Malfoy) early on in their friendship.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“For the first two movies, I had a huge crush on Tom Felton. He was my first crush,” the Beauty and the Beast star told <a href=#>Seventeen</a> in June 2011. “He totally knows. We talked about it — we still laugh about it. We are really good friends now, and that’s cool.”</p><p>Scroll down to revisit the wildest and the most understandable celebrity crushes of all time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwLWt0axkmqaUYsGpscirZJydnJqvs7XTsmScqqWotaa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

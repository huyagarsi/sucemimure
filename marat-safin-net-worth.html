I have comrades who say, 'You are already 40 years old. It's time to start a family and children.' And I understand that everyone has their own time for this. I am ready, in principle, to live without children, a girl or a wife. If I meet a person who will be an interesting partner to me, then yes. But I don't want to do this for the sake of a tick." In 2008, Marat told "USA Today," "I'm Russian, but I'm 100% Muslim. All the Muslim people are passionate, stubborn. We have hot blood."

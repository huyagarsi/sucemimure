The talk show host revealed in an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>ABC News</a> on July 8, “People do think I was born a man.”</p><p>The topic came up when the 49-year-old was asked about transgender Orange Is the New Black star <strong>Laverne Cox</strong> (who just became the first transgender person to be nominated for an Emmy), but Williams instead opted to address her own rumor mill.</p><p>“That is absolutely not [true],” she said of claims she’s actually a male. The opinionated host went on to say she understands why some might think that, though.</p><p>“I get it. I’ve got a strong face, a strong body, I’m 5’11. I wear wigs. I get it,” she said graciously with a smile. “Do I get upset with it? No.”</p><p>But that doesn’t mean Williams enjoys being called a man. “I get where that comes from, but in my opinion, there’s no worse way to insult a woman than to say she looks like a man … [but] there’s nothing you can call me at this particular point. I’ve been dealing with this for decades.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Something else the talk show host has been dealing with for years is abuse. As a child, Williams said her parents would “fat shame” her.</p><p>“I had a very tortured childhood,” she claimed. “I didn’t grow up the popular girl, or the popular cheerleader. I’ve never been to a prom, I didn’t have a lot of boyfriends, so I’m used to being on this side of life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawnZ6Zxm7DyKWjopmdqHqosdOsZLCgqWK9prvPpZxmrJieu6x50qGcrGWRYrqiuoxrZ2psYWWEcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

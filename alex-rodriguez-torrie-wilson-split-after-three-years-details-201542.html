The baseball slugger, 39, and his girlfriend <strong>Torrie Wilson</strong> have called it quits, multiple sources confirm to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The New York Yankee began dating the blonde model and WWE stunner, also 39, in late 2011. Rodriguez and wife of six years, <strong>Cynthia Scurtis</strong>, separated in 2008 and later divorced amidst a <a href=#>much-rumored affair</a> with <strong><a href=#>Madonna</a></strong>, who was married to <strong><a href=#>Guy Ritchie</a></strong> at the time.</p><p>Soon after the end of his marriage, Rodriguez started up a talked-about relationship with <strong><a href=#>Kate Hudson</a></strong>. He and the actress split in December 2009 after less than a year together. The next year, Rodriguez coupled up with another A-list blonde, Hudson's pal <strong><a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a></strong>, whom he dated for about a year until mid-2011. Months later, he fell for Wilson.&nbsp;</p><p>The two stars maintained a serious relationship for more than three years, but recently parted ways. While Rodriguez and Wilson haven't officially confirmed their breakup, a source tells Us Weekly that the athlete is already taking advantage of his newly single status.</p><p>An eyewitness saw Rodriguez "hitting on every petite pretty blonde" at a Super Bowl party this past weekend now that he is back on the market.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"They had fun but he just has commitment issues, which is no surprise," a second source adds. "She expected it for a few months and he was good to her while they were together."</p><p>Wilson, who previously dated fellow wrestler <strong>Nick Mitchell</strong> and was married to WWE star <strong>Billy Kidman</strong> aka <strong>Peter Gruner</strong>, has yet to comment on the breakup.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>She did retweet</a> a message from blogger <strong>Dale Partridge</strong> reading, "Beautiful things happen when you distance yourself from negativity," and posted a photo <a href=#>via Instagram</a> of herself with a close pal, captioning the shot, "There's nothing like a #Friend who has been there to see it all. #NeverForgetYourGirlsLadies #TampaLife #ForeverAGirlsGirl."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJilnahiv7Cw0aKerp2qYsGwvtGinGavmaHAsLqMrKeloaRirqfAxKtkraCimrJuxcSaqaxllJrBorXLrGRraGFqgXM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

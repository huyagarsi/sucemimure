This quest involves investigating several murders, saving three soon-to-be murder victims, and descending to the Temple of Bhaal.</p><p data-injection=true>Despite the build-up, nothing prepares you for meeting Baldur’s Gate’s main antagonist Sarevok Anchev down there. He’s somehow alive and acting as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Murder Tribunal</a>‘s judge. His presence is commanding and intimidating, and to name you an Unholy Assassin, he has one final request: kill Investigator <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Valeria</a>. Yes, the drunk hollyphant with a monocle.&nbsp;</p><strong>Table of Contents</strong><ul><li><a href=#>Murder Tribunal BG3: Kill Hollyphant Investigator Valeria in Baldur’s Gate 3</a></li><li><a href=#>Murder Tribunal BG3: Kill Sarevok Anchev in Baldur’s Gate 3</a></li><li><a href=#>Should You Kill Valeria or Sarevok?</a></li></ul><h2 id=0-murder-tribunal-bg3-kill-hollyphant-investigator-valeria-in-baldurs-gate-3>Murder Tribunal BG3: Kill Hollyphant Investigator Valeria in Baldur’s Gate 3</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Baldurs-Gate-3-Kill-Investigator-Valeria.jpg><p>If you’ve satisfactorily impressed the Murder Tribunal lying underneath Candulhallow’s Tombstones with your murder-y exploits, they’ll lead you to the Sacrificial Chamber where you’ll find a literal pool of blood and Valeria, the Hollyphant Investigator, restrained on a platform.</p><p data-injection=true>Muster the strength to kill this adorable hollyphant with a monocle, and Sarevok will <strong>appoint you the title of Unholy Assasin</strong>. No boss fight is required. Inspector Valeria is chained and will yell some both hilarious and upsetting dialogue as she’s slayed.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3: How to Complete Rescue Orin’s Victim in BG3</a></p><p data-injection=true>After bathing in the blood of the sacrifices, Sarevok commands you to kill Orin and remove her “girlish” altars. He even goes as far as calling you family. Yikes.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=1-murder-tribunal-bg3-kill-sarevok-anchev-in-baldurs-gate-3>Murder Tribunal BG3: Kill Sarevok Anchev in Baldur’s Gate 3</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Baldurs-Gate-3-Sarevok-or-Valeria.jpg><p data-injection=true>Refusing to go through with Valeria’s sacrifice means standing up against Sarevok Anchev, ultimately sacrificing the title of Unholy Assassin.</p><p>A battle against a <strong>level 16 Sarevok Anchev</strong> and the rest of the tribunal of Echoes will ensue. Though the battle is admittedly easy to beat with a level 12 party and well-rested party members, this action takes a stance against Orin, who happens to be his granddaughter.&nbsp;</p><p data-injection=true>Valeria will live, extends her gratitude for saving her life, and become an ally in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gather Your Allies</a> main quest. Plus, looting Sarevok Anchev’s corpse provides some sweet loot. In both outcomes, <strong>Orin becomes the next target for killing</strong>. Killing Valeria does spare a boss fight against Baldur’s Gate’s main antagonist.</p><h2 id=2-should-you-kill-valeria-or-sarevok>Should You Kill Valeria or Sarevok?</h2><p>Whether you choose to kill Valeria or Sarevok in BG3 ultimately depends on how you’re playing the game, as both choices largely lead to the same outcome.</p><p>You should <strong>kill Valeria if</strong>:</p><ul data-injection=true><li>You want the path of least resistance.</li><li>You’re roleplaying as a character with an evil streak.</li><li>You just don’t much care for Valeria (she is kind of obnoxious).</li></ul><p>You should <strong>kill Sarevok if</strong>:</p><ul><li>You want to engage in a boss fight.</li><li>You’re staunchly against all that is evil.</li><li>You want Valeria as an ally in the Gather Your Allies quest.</li><li>You want Sarevok’s sweet, sweet loot, including his Sword of Chaos and Horned Helmet.</li></ul><p data-injection=true>No matter how you look at it, choosing to kill Sarevok over Valeria leads to a more rewarding outcome, and it’s the path we’d recommend if only to nab his sword. Sarevok’s Sword of Chaos is a Very Rare greatsword that deals additional Necrotic damage while also healing the wielder with each successful strike. It’s extremely powerful and hard to pass up.</p><p>But we wouldn’t blame you if you want to kill Valeria just to quickly get past the area. The Hollyphant may look cute, but she certainly has her flaws.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dd39bd735ebf6fbf05d2fe8f91a978f7?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Cande Maldonado</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Though Cande started her journey in the video game industry as a localization specialist six years ago, she soon realized that her true calling was to annoy NPCS, smash virtual pottery, and complete every side quest available in RPGs.

Her passion for games dates to 2006, when she mounted a Chocobo for the first time.

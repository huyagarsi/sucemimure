He will only be able to negotiate a signing bonus, and even that would be somewhat limited by international bonus pool restrictions.</p><p>What's more, his NPB team wouldn't receive the same type of compensation as usual when a player is posted for a jump to MLB.</p><p>While that figures to create more of an open market where the big-spending teams aren't the only ones legitimately interested in signing Sasaki, he will likely have his pick of suitors. With money not as much of a factor, that could give contenders who would give him an immediate opportunity to compete for a World Series something of an advantage in discussions.</p><p>Any team would be more of a contender if he was on the roster.</p><p>Across <a href=# rel=noopener>all levels</a> to this point, Sasaki has a 1.94 ERA, 0.86 WHIP and 456 strikeouts in 375.1 innings. He throws his fastball at 103 mph with a nasty splitter to keep hitters guessing, and that combination will surely still play against major league competition.</p><p>It's now something of a waiting game until Sasaki is the next pitching star to reach that level from Japan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmeDcoCMpqObZaKqurC%2B0marnpmdqHqxuMCnpaKml2KzsL6Mo5ipmZ6awKZ50qlkq6ebnnq0rdKaoqJlpKR6o7GMqaasrJWZeqq6jGtna2xdZ4I%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

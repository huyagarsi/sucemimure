The Blue actress opened up about the 1999 classic that put her on the map to <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> during the Orphaned Starfish Gala in NYC on Friday, Oct. 17.</p><p>Eager to reflect back, Stiles, 33, revealed that her drunk house party table dance helped her land the role of Sara in 2001’s Save the Last Dance. Plus, she paid tribute to the late<strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Heath Ledger</a></strong>, who played her love interest Patrick. The Oscar winner’s rendition of Frankie Valli’s “Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You” scene during Stratford’s soccer practice is still one of the film’s biggest takeaways. Check out what she told <strong>Us</strong> — and see if she can still recite that 10 Things poem from memory!</p><p><strong>Us Weekly: What are some of your favorite 10 Things I Hate About You memories?</strong><br><strong>Julia Stiles:</strong> Oh wow, that was so long ago! Just how well the cast got along. It was such a fun summer and such a pure experience of working on a movie where we were all — this was our first big break. We were really open and invested and it was really fun being in Seattle.</p><p><strong>US:</strong> Did you keep any props from set?<br><strong>JS:</strong> No, I’m not somebody who likes to keep stuff. I like to be light on my feet, so I did not.</p><p><strong>US: How many takes did it take to film the table dance scene from Bogey Lowenstein’s party?</strong><br><strong>JS:</strong> It was like 15 years ago, I don’t really remember! I think like once or twice. That’s how I got the job in Save the Last Dance by the way; I think it was from that scene. That’s what I was told.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Julia-Stiles-10-Things-I-Hate-About-You-Role-Helped-Her-Land-Save-the-Last-Dance-2.jpg><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>US: Who do you keep in touch with?</strong><br><strong>JS:</strong> Just <strong>Larisa [Oleynik]</strong> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Joe [Gordon-Levitt]</strong></a> a little bit…I just did the play [Phoenix] and Larisa came to see it. It was really nice to reconnect with her. [Actor] <strong>David Krumholtz</strong> and the writers too.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>US: What was it like to work with Heath Ledger?</strong><br><strong>JS:</strong> Amazing, amazing he was so nice. He was such a force; he was…even at that age a very very powerful, lovely human being.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Julia-Stiles-10-Things-I-Hate-About-You-Role-Helped-Her-Land-Save-the-Last-Dance-3.jpg><p><strong>US: Would you be up for a reunion with the cast?</strong><br><strong>JS:</strong> I would! I feel like a reunion would be nice.</p><p><strong>US: Lastly, are you still able to recite Kat Stratford’s emotional poem she recited at the end of the film?</strong><br><strong>JS:</strong> Not the whole thing no, maybe the end. Bits and pieces — it’s all gone! ‘What I hate the most of all, is that I don’t hate you at all.’ Something like that. You have to clear out space to memorize other lines!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGupJmWerTAyKWcrGWklrmsv4xqZ2asmJ67qL%2BMomShmaSaeqKuzq6rZrGfqnq1tMRmo5qslWK1pq3ToWSlnZScsrN5jGtnamxnZn4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

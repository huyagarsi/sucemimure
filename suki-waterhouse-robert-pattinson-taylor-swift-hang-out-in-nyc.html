For the occasion, Waterhouse paired a sheer white top that cascaded to the floor with satin pants from Dissh, a leather jacket and a knit scarf.</p><p>Her boyfriend, meanwhile, kept it casual in a black baseball cap, a red-and-white plaid shirt, a dark coat and matching pants.</p><p>Waterhouse <a href=#>confirmed pregnancy rumors</a> last month while performing in Mexico City on November 19. “I thought I’d wear something sparkly today because I thought it might distract you from something else that’s going on,” she told fans while gesturing to <a href=#>her baby bump</a>, which was highly visible in a fitted mini dress. “I’m not sure if it’s working.” The crowd responded with enthusiastic cheers after her announcement.</p><p>Days later, a source exclusively <a href=#>opened up to Us Weekly</a> about Waterhouse’s pregnancy.</p><p>“[Suki and Robert] moved in together earlier this year and decided it was finally the right time to expand their family,” the insider said, adding that the duo “really hid this pregnancy well from friends before they were ready to reveal the happy news.”</p><p>The source noted that “Suki and Rob couldn’t be more thrilled and they feel beyond blessed.”</p><p>The couple started dating in 2018 after meeting through mutual friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Suki-Waterhouse-and-Robert-Pattison-Make-1st-Public-Appearance-Since-Announcing-Her-Pregnancy.jpg><p>Swift and Waterhouse, meanwhile, have known each other for more than seven years.

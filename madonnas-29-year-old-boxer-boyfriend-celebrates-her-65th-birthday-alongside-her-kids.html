This past weekend, the Material Girl did just that, and was joined by her 29-year-old boxer boyfriend as she celebrated her 65th birthday alongside her kids.</p><p>Over the weekend, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madonna went all out as she celebrated her 65th birthday in Lisbon, Portugal</a>. While she was joined by her children, Lourdes, 26, David Banda, 17, Mercy James, 17, and 10-year-old twins Stella and Estere, it was her oldest son Rocco, 23, that the attention revolved around momentarily, as he was introduced to Madonna's boyfriend, Joshua Popper, for the first time.</p><p>While there were no reports about how the meeting went between the two, according to The Sun, the family celebrated the night away together. An indication that there was no bad blood between Rocco or Joshua.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the evening, the drinks were flowing, the music was playing, and Lourdes even put on an impromptu show for her mother.

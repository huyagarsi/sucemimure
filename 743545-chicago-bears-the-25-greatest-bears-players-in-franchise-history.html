You have to remember that in those days, teams simply did not pass the ball a lot so Luckman's accomplishments cannot be measured by just statistics.</p><p>Yet even his stats were great. Tied for most TD passes in a game (7); three-time league leader in TD passes;&nbsp;averaged 8.4&nbsp;yards per attempt, second best all-time; 1943 performance of&nbsp;13.9 percent touchdown rate (best ever in a single-season), and&nbsp;his 10.9&nbsp;yards per attempt is second all-time; first ever 400-yard passing performance and 28 TDs in a season was a record that lasted for many years.</p><p>Yes, his overall numbers, particularly his TD to interception rate, may not be impressive. But in addition to the records I described above, he was the QB in the 73-0 1940 title game and was the 1943 MVP.</p><p>Luckman led the NFL in yards per attempt an NFL record seven times, including a record five consecutive years from 1939&nbsp;to&nbsp;1943.</p><p>A winner? Well, he led the "Monsters of the Midway" to championships in 1940, 1941, 1943, and 1946.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJobm1rZWmCbq%2FHopqan59ir6at0axkraCVYn92ecarnJqslajBbq7EmqmsZaChrrqx0axkoqZdm7%2BiusKhoKydXZ22tMDOq7A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogB - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
